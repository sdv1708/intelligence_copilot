A: And then the meeting Conceptual design individual work and a meeting detailed design Individual work in the meeting 200.79 208.49 ES2007a.A.spurt.52 Flip it open and you got all the buttons or you flip it closing you just got there 878.04 882.23 ES2007a.A.spurt.320 And then on the of the sign what one uh remote control that would be very very simple was just the channel program plus and minus and then just the mute button for example i can we keep it really really simple one side and the other side be very complicated 839.48 854.21 ES2007a.B.spurt.308 I think the flip up thing "'cause" you always have this problem of like if its own that's what i did a way to get five or six remotes an alkaline on the on the cat's use common sit down and all that elephants the television set start 1038.73 1051.29 ES2007a.D.spurt.391
B: thirty percent of the users say they only use ten percent of the buttons on the remote so 1113.01 1117.22 ES2007b.D.spurt.431 exactly basically we we design we design in I'm marketing television remote control unit we're not 585.68 592.06 ES2007b.A.spurt.234 Making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years because technology you would change them you know we wanna televisions in ten years time 1440.58 1449.09 ES2007b.A.spurt.561 Is it yellow but it was yellow and blue i i kind of so it was blue buying a yellow background but i might be just done that 1530.73 1537.28 ES2007b.A.spurt.608
C: If it's not double curve then we've got the choice for the pushbuttons if it's a double curved we've gotta go for rubber push buttons 528.74 534.33 ES2007c.B.spurt.195 For example titanium you call use it fold if you if we choosing a double curved case we can choose titanium 416.64 423.7 ES2007c.B.spurt.149 and if we choose double curve then we have to go for rubber push buttons 519.22 522.16 ES2007c.B.spurt.191 I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go uh i don't know why but we need to go for uh rubber push buttons 585.4 592.26 ES2007c.B.spurt.214
D: Gonna do it all together so evaluating each criteria i've got the criterias 533.4 537.03 ES2007d.D.spurt.262 And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven one being true so it's it it's more like it's fits the criteria and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria 537.78 548.1 ES2007d.D.spurt.263 So at this stage i mean this is the last meeting of the project we don't have another one after it's com com to market market or something 895.71 902.57 ES2007d.C.spurt.448 That was the main criteria from the last meeting you had to teach you proof 333.34 336.34 ES2007d.C.spurt.178
A: Yeah that's true a user name it doesn't have to have a flip function at least have a lock functions so that it's not uh 1071.62 1076.87 ES2007a.C.spurt.401 So we we start time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface But the the functions that were sure that we want our that it can 912.05 919.08 ES2007a.C.spurt.336 Project aim is a new remote control 185.72 188.87 ES2007a.A.spurt.46 Functional design 196.38 197.55 ES2007a.A.spurt.50
B: total number of people tested one hundred just so you know so that hundred people tested and these were the findings so it's at five percent of users find the remote control ugly 1074.84 1085.53 ES2007b.D.spurt.417 Well the twenty five to thirty five euro and thirty five and thirty five to forty five forty five point seven percent 1237.17 1243.6 ES2007b.D.spurt.483 And that that's that that's that's quite a mono uh in as a as a team at fifty fifty that's thirty five percent 1267.74 1274.38 ES2007b.A.spurt.496 Yes it should we just one disk of losses so that people are gonna so this in ten years time say your remote control get mean the best a strain injury 1332.42 1340.12 ES2007b.A.spurt.522
C: This was the difference between a normal rubber case um rubble double double rubber double curved 551.58 555.92 ES2007c.C.spurt.202 We've chosen role rubber and if now we have the choice for the case where there it's flat single curved or double curved 577.51 584.67 ES2007c.B.spurt.213 You see still get you tell you still get repetitive strain injury when you're pressing a button or pressing a flat the screen 917.72 924.01 ES2007c.A.spurt.362 So if you use a rabbit double curved case you must use rubber push buttons 506.93 512.2 ES2007c.B.spurt.188
D: Okay that's criteria look and feel so it does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about as it is it 585.49 591.65 ES2007d.D.spurt.275 I mean it's only pressing buttons you don't have to do anything you know extraordinary i think it would be compatible with the left and right hand side 221.21 228.07 ES2007d.D.spurt.118 Yeah that's not a technological same as another thing it as another marketing things on the technical side of it 631.8 637.22 ES2007d.A.spurt.305 Remotes got on the market 78.74 79.99 ES2007d.C.spurt.40
A: Technical functions design what affect the apparatus should have 907.07 909.79 ES2007a.C.spurt.333 Uh winning acquaintance tool training project plan discussion And then closing 177.29 183.1 ES2007a.A.spurt.45 One side kids one side for adults 854.53 856.55 ES2007a.A.spurt.309 Next meeting starts in thirty minutes 621.12 623.95 ES2007a.A.spurt.217
B: If if remote control what i've telephones can be fashionable then maybe a remote control units can be 978.06 982.83 ES2007b.A.spurt.377 eighty eighty percent of them would spend more money if the what remote control look really cool fancy 1089.65 1094.98 ES2007b.D.spurt.420 So we have the trends i could uh big yellow and black remote as far as uh as maybe that's our next meeting that we discussed 1525.66 1531.45 ES2007b.C.spurt.607 but now than others so that most people that have the money uh people from the age of thirty five to fifty five 1256.43 1262.2 ES2007b.A.spurt.490
C: If we use Double curved case then we have to you she used rubber push buttons that's fine 875.3 882.0 ES2007c.B.spurt.344 Then the case do you want it to facts or curved or single or double curved 858.35 863.28 ES2007c.B.spurt.334 The yeah the example that they are they using it for is with the coffee machine where basically you can programme A sample that um 775.63 782.99 ES2007c.C.spurt.298 So picky layout and design a really crucial you don't want uh you want people to build a quickly access the buttons that they use lot without uh was pressing along one 1111.66 1119.84 ES2007c.C.spurt.434
D: That you know that it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes are actually to give you press the strain injury 1043.06 1050.98 ES2007d.A.spurt.501 Designer put that we've met we've Got a prototype is within budget it's does everything 992.23 997.73 ES2007d.A.spurt.483 Oh i'm not a put it in one of my email side Send off 1037.57 1041.19 ES2007d.A.spurt.499 That's the design that's a that's a that's a design thing yeah 632.44 635.15 ES2007d.C.spurt.306
A: Yeah i think we're doing before we close the meeting was supposed to come up with some ideas for 645.97 649.39 ES2007a.C.spurt.224 Project method 194.74 195.85 ES2007a.A.spurt.49 Uh huh project finance selling price twenty five euros 580.28 584.08 ES2007a.A.spurt.202 I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote that "'cause" it would be very Hard to use in the way that you but then you can do that 859.43 865.72 ES2007a.C.spurt.312
B: Basically the majority seven forty five to fifty five euros for some reason didn't want a voice activated one and needed to be older generation but the younger generation who we are catering for 1219.46 1228.1 ES2007b.D.spurt.478 Already existing remote trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there 708.69 713.02 ES2007b.C.spurt.265 We could keep the corporate image should within this remote control unit is gonna look like it's an i. r. and r. 949.3 955.89 ES2007b.A.spurt.364 text was time to learn how to use a new remote especially for uh the older generation 1145.74 1150.14 ES2007b.D.spurt.447
C: so the pushbuttons and sell it can be just simple they can be so that's just the electronics between that that behind the pushbuttons 609.91 616.94 ES2007c.B.spurt.226 And and the other pushbuttons so you can have basic push buttons or scroll wheels like to have on a mouse 487.01 493.42 ES2007c.B.spurt.179 Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and it and that the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that you mean 1820.78 1827.75 ES2007c.A.spurt.752 Well as that can be counted of market research thing you know that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular 1974.57 1980.57 ES2007c.A.spurt.815
D: Funny all design the meetings could be this quick 864.62 866.58 ES2007d.D.spurt.435 And the criteria is that are 549.17 550.74 ES2007d.D.spurt.264 So the first criteria 580.71 581.86 ES2007d.D.spurt.272 So i'll just write criteria 604.33 605.65 ES2007d.D.spurt.285
A: Everyone lasted remotes the side 1031.0 1032.7 ES2007a.C.spurt.387 it's industrial designer which is not to go first 228.78 231.19 ES2007a.A.spurt.59 This asset six designer you're left go next 314.65 317.61 ES2007a.A.spurt.97 Industrial designer 1111.79 1112.95 ES2007a.A.spurt.426
B: Uh yellow and blue going on them 962.33 964.14 ES2007b.A.spurt.368 Well sec wait on a white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders 1536.93 1541.15 ES2007b.C.spurt.609 For the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about 166.48 170.15 ES2007b.A.spurt.70 No i would i would say the older the older people 1234.51 1236.66 ES2007b.C.spurt.482
C: Come up with that the user interface design and by c. e. two are gonna be working together 2015.39 2020.51 ES2007c.A.spurt.828 You know kind of more way gonna make that kind of sits that paul the hands like kind of thing 386.75 392.49 ES2007c.B.spurt.141 Of buttons ideally i mean it like power channel up channel down volume up volume down the numerical keep that 1219.32 1225.13 ES2007c.C.spurt.482 You can have a a curved one or double curved one 378.32 381.99 ES2007c.B.spurt.138
D: Criteria what 606.74 607.5 ES2007d.D.spurt.286 Second criteria 611.43 612.34 ES2007d.D.spurt.288 "'kay" criteria for 679.38 680.74 ES2007d.D.spurt.333 Criteria six r. s. i. is a good i guess yes 700.43 704.05 ES2007d.D.spurt.347
A: User interface designer that's 1124.45 1126.55 ES2007a.A.spurt.437 Industrial design you're the one that you know you're gonna be working out 1138.31 1141.4 ES2007a.A.spurt.445 "'cause" it's so you don't accidentally press a button or record buttons or something 1058.17 1062.42 ES2007a.D.spurt.394 Like a whole lot or something like that flip telephone something that that maybe 870.9 875.51 ES2007a.A.spurt.316
B: Probably if you have like one two three four five the whole out of ten they probably don't use those are only used up and down channel 1117.68 1125.06 ES2007b.D.spurt.432 Maybe the buttons so how yeah so you don't to press so much we we just like flat buttons be 1361.08 1366.36 ES2007b.D.spurt.535 um batteries can get like annoying the battery's down and 495.28 498.09 ES2007b.D.spurt.202 I mean we can look into using this would be know the little tiny weeny batteries a lot special long lasting batteries 1426.59 1432.87 ES2007b.A.spurt.558
C: Provision of energy which is used on some watches these days so if you have just a bit of ten to movement that it won't give it the energy to work 308.91 316.96 ES2007c.B.spurt.113 But if we choosing just the flat case then we can go for it thing 432.97 436.37 ES2007c.B.spurt.152 Standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury well this remote control is designs to the complete opposite 2141.04 2146.96 ES2007c.A.spurt.873 yeah so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of Of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products 1021.54 1030.25 ES2007c.C.spurt.399
D: And criteria seven was the last and that they get lost is easy to get lost 708.4 712.22 ES2007d.D.spurt.352 We fit it all the criteria i i 772.61 776.28 ES2007d.D.spurt.392 The thumb button is the power button 97.19 98.67 ES2007d.C.spurt.51 But then you can learn to use you're right click i was thinking it's it's left and design right-handers in the family 197.29 203.49 ES2007d.D.spurt.109
A: But i guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least uh 900.83 903.33 ES2007a.C.spurt.331 Well we've been want to finish the meeting now 1187.37 1189.37 ES2007a.A.spurt.473 Okay everyone well done a good meeting 1196.0 1197.9 ES2007a.A.spurt.475 Well Have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the t. v. d. and b. c. or excess and stuff 831.23 839.03 ES2007a.B.spurt.307
B: What about this from the the perspective of our manufacturing cost and you know if it's twelve fifty per unit 1277.95 1283.02 ES2007b.C.spurt.498 But but to the younger generation have the money they they don't is older generation of the ones are gonna um 1232.11 1238.17 ES2007b.A.spurt.480 So the working design have got a very quick presentation on this so 332.84 336.9 ES2007b.B.spurt.136 It it's that's just one particular meeting if you have no time to prepare one 234.35 238.32 ES2007b.A.spurt.92
C: The sample sensor sample speaker 749.79 752.03 ES2007c.D.spurt.284 It's just a sample sensor sample output 1044.39 1046.28 ES2007c.C.spurt.405 Well that that's I think given the customer into more control over what the boring instead of you call colours on the on off 1944.6 1950.7 ES2007c.D.spurt.804 Well if if it's not chip on print and i guess you get defend chip components And you build them separately and doesn't include infrared 692.33 700.63 ES2007c.B.spurt.256
D: Yeah well but to use on this to be on the market 880.81 883.43 ES2007d.A.spurt.442 I think if you put this in the palm of your hand 82.31 84.07 ES2007d.C.spurt.42 I think i might just wanna put in 788.69 790.66 ES2007d.A.spurt.399 Um put a pain with a camera on it i don't think it's such a new 1208.77 1212.19 ES2007d.A.spurt.571
A: all all the functions of t. v. and if you have 723.08 725.09 ES2007a.C.spurt.258 like a lot of like a loc facts functional it like you have any telephones yeah 1060.88 1065.03 ES2007a.A.spurt.396 With remote control So i talk about it 609.59 612.38 ES2007a.A.spurt.213 What our experiences with remote controls and then and what we would 664.86 668.23 ES2007a.C.spurt.232
B: Well we all know that it's a it's a remote control we're gonna be dealing with I think the first thing we should look at is um 279.49 286.29 ES2007b.A.spurt.115 Then on the uh remote control itself will have um 386.35 391.47 ES2007b.B.spurt.157 we observed remote control users in usability lab 1063.06 1066.02 ES2007b.D.spurt.413 Okay so we don't like the look of the remote control 1086.38 1088.44 ES2007b.D.spurt.418
C: Connect for example you if you get a call on your mobile phone but you more mobile phone is downstairs is something you would get on this solution you been called by this person right now 1508.96 1517.46 ES2007c.B.spurt.603 and the price but there was it with it so the simple push buttons are gonna be the cheapest 619.1 625.11 ES2007c.B.spurt.229 Solar cells then we can choose latex for the case material so we just have to take that into account 427.02 432.29 ES2007c.B.spurt.151 Tu-dum still be a simple buttons we're not gonna be done for the new technological chip-on-print expensive things so we we keep the costs down 2117.51 2125.93 ES2007c.A.spurt.867
D: Yeah there are designer there are some 824.86 826.75 ES2007d.C.spurt.413 I think so i you know and i think we've got we have come we've come up with something in something that hasn't been done before where we're not just rehashing old design 851.97 860.37 ES2007d.A.spurt.431 Poker yeah we design and now we leave this 888.22 890.76 ES2007d.A.spurt.444 Very simple and easy to use 66.28 67.92 ES2007d.C.spurt.34
A: Right it on experiences with remote controls and 674.86 677.3 ES2007a.A.spurt.235 Yeah it's t. v. remote control 687.11 688.44 ES2007a.D.spurt.243 And new remote control for t. v. 693.62 695.19 ES2007a.D.spurt.247 No it doesn't have to be really thick every remote controls can be with the minutes to an end 804.04 808.44 ES2007a.D.spurt.294
B: Current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user 1099.13 1103.0 ES2007b.D.spurt.424 Well see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company mean she's gonna say they will go to look at this remote control and it in sunny recogniser that's a real reaction I product 1551.28 1560.69 ES2007b.A.spurt.617 Yeah repetitive strain injury so they don't I think people watch t. v. maybe to what think you change and channel that's the rest 1303.44 1309.68 ES2007b.D.spurt.510 The basic functionality that people want 738.36 740.05 ES2007b.C.spurt.276
C: Yeah just just by the fact that choosing 1965.24 1966.8 ES2007c.C.spurt.810 Okay so i'll go back maybe to see the previous slide and we can decide for each problem what we should cheese so for the energy source to be go for the battery all day 831.55 840.34 ES2007c.B.spurt.327 So what you say maybe we should market it in different colours For different so we could do that the pink line is the blue line is the green lines that 1926.93 1934.8 ES2007c.A.spurt.799 That's why thinking bluetooth "'cause" it's flat put a blue to use them as a a bluetooth remote control and it's got like a Because bluetooth is the in thing nowadays Like really think 1428.93 1438.31 ES2007c.D.spurt.570
D: And for electronics we decided on it being just a simple the easiest 358.64 363.62 ES2007d.A.spurt.192 Yeah i mean these these ones on the side or curved kind of stuff 401.76 405.0 ES2007d.C.spurt.206 And there any special material no no not not made of wood or titanium rubber i mean it just simple 410.08 416.63 ES2007d.A.spurt.210 Okay this this side this so i can imagine 450.51 453.44 ES2007d.A.spurt.231
A: We should have a backup plan or just a a really good television remote control 942.56 946.46 ES2007a.A.spurt.345 Pretty cat 421.73 422.32 ES2007a.A.spurt.145 And usually cats very friendly usually 440.07 443.44 ES2007a.D.spurt.153 So that's i like cats 458.13 459.42 ES2007a.D.spurt.159
B: You can you know however you wanna do you all know presentation basically you can 243.01 247.82 ES2007b.A.spurt.94 Television remote 1389.09 1390.02 ES2007b.A.spurt.545 Included i forgot that we talked about last time was doing um some sort of a lot of function 765.87 770.15 ES2007b.C.spurt.285 Yeah but if like it on the phone the other room we need to the television or something you don't really want to go and we put the time for them to go into hmm 541.16 548.1 ES2007b.D.spurt.218
C: I also to irises marketing findings from the last meeting and to consideration 1005.83 1011.12 ES2007c.C.spurt.394 I think specially maybe younger "'cause" it's in pink the pack a remote control for the room 1920.2 1924.77 ES2007c.D.spurt.797 For the energy sources we can have an a basic battery uh 290.91 295.84 ES2007c.B.spurt.105 I mean that that seems to work well what products like ipod where you know you have a variety of colours that people feel like the customising it wanna buy it you know 1957.32 1964.8 ES2007c.C.spurt.807
D: Every everything else is fairly simple but the fact that we use the kinetic energy was new 624.99 629.17 ES2007d.C.spurt.298 In the corporate oh that's next to the corporate simple 1089.49 1092.98 ES2007d.A.spurt.521 That's the log button as well 110.33 112.02 ES2007d.C.spurt.58 Uh on a banana "'em" as a mute button 112.42 114.39 ES2007d.C.spurt.60
A: I missed it but it's just start off i am see what happens 159.93 163.46 ES2007a.A.spurt.41 So i think before we close the were expected uh in the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer or whatever 632.6 638.23 ES2007a.C.spurt.220 Well the moment week to uh remote "'cause" we this about with the what we do in a remote is just saying what what we'd like and then after we want to find what we can like some different ideas We can end and do research to find out if these any of these ideas or feasible or not 773.79 788.52 ES2007a.A.spurt.285 Remote spending uh from other remotes 1028.73 1030.45 ES2007a.C.spurt.384
B: Okay alright welcome to the meeting be 133.0 135.25 ES2007b.A.spurt.57 This is gonna go a lot but in the last meeting 136.89 138.99 ES2007b.A.spurt.59 How long as the meeting 214.92 215.79 ES2007b.B.spurt.84 This meeting is a little it's uh 216.12 218.49 ES2007b.A.spurt.85
C: Then you have the case is uh whether it's flat a curved 561.64 565.91 ES2007c.B.spurt.210 Yeah why should we will buy this one level you got a remote that kind of that serious 1375.75 1379.46 ES2007c.A.spurt.542 So i already mentioned uh speech recognition interface i guess we we basically you know that idea It's it's pointless 1034.62 1042.07 ES2007c.C.spurt.402 Let's have rubber push buttons i 599.8 601.41 ES2007c.A.spurt.219
D: Was as to what button and 115.7 117.39 ES2007d.A.spurt.62 And is button supplements well then 388.12 391.24 ES2007d.A.spurt.200 The buttons a rubber 418.09 418.9 ES2007d.C.spurt.213 Man a buttons 691.29 692.56 ES2007d.A.spurt.340

B: A u. up a you joining in this meeting here 264.32 266.57 ES2007b.A.spurt.103 Judging from what what we are talked about during our last meeting a kind of gather that 819.6 823.31 ES2007b.C.spurt.310 hmmm considering get icsi define the l. the next meeting 1349.93 1353.61 ES2007b.A.spurt.531 If we sit for finished five minutes before the meeting supposed to finish saying that means be an extra five minutes for lunch 1642.91 1649.13 ES2007b.A.spurt.658
C: Well the rubber push button so 902.91 904.36 ES2007c.D.spurt.356 And also a recent investigation that we've done in remote control market 1351.56 1356.0 ES2007c.D.spurt.536 We have found that for a remote control market 1357.1 1359.16 ES2007c.D.spurt.537 I can speak with the button department that uh i think that should be easy to have a button it just prevents prevents the other 1304.08 1310.6 ES2007c.C.spurt.521
D: Like the amount buttons "'cause" people like a lot let black 693.12 695.98 ES2007d.D.spurt.341 Contains only the necessary buttons 694.4 696.71 ES2007d.A.spurt.342 In fort if in in for meetings 861.55 863.83 ES2007d.D.spurt.433 No i think when it's meetings finished but officially then we'll get a a questionnaire 901.34 906.95 ES2007d.A.spurt.450
A: Big buttons for 986.09 987.12 ES2007a.A.spurt.362 Touchy buttons uh 987.91 989.11 ES2007a.A.spurt.363 Yeah you're you're you're in we want it to look at what what buttons we need 1131.27 1134.63 ES2007a.A.spurt.442 What buttons to use more often and stuff like that 1182.3 1185.19 ES2007a.A.spurt.471
B: uh probably don't about thirty five minutes now 218.49 220.76 ES2007b.A.spurt.86 For up be well up to the age of thirty five 1249.93 1252.86 ES2007b.A.spurt.487 Yeah it works for the last Fifty years yeah 506.38 509.62 ES2007b.A.spurt.207 It's in blue a um i could and change the way it's fine on my screen but no mic 345.35 350.54 ES2007b.B.spurt.140
C: One double curved one 384.57 385.87 ES2007c.A.spurt.140 Yeah but is it the double curved one or not 526.05 527.95 ES2007c.B.spurt.194 Double curved 868.46 869.39 ES2007c.C.spurt.337 If it's rubber as an indelible anyways i mean it doesn't matter if it's double i mean isn't a a rubber case mean it's completely 541.58 547.14 ES2007c.C.spurt.198
D: Meeting agenda 1243.0 1244.04 ES2007d.D.spurt.586 Remote so you can you know 155.95 157.24 ES2007d.C.spurt.83 Want to have two remotes 204.1 205.37 ES2007d.D.spurt.110 I think actually trying to find ideas for uh radio remote 873.1 875.79 ES2007d.C.spurt.437
A: Control 393.4 394.11 ES2007a.D.spurt.136 So the be nice to have something that that controls Lots of different things 789.51 793.65 ES2007a.A.spurt.287 Control the t. v. but also devices connected to the 919.53 921.99 ES2007a.C.spurt.337 I have got i think we should also have a backup plan of i "'cause" i i just think that might be expensive to make something that i mean we don't we have been told has to be something that all control everything 930.69 941.7 ES2007a.A.spurt.343
B: The blue think 1019.24 1019.74 ES2007b.D.spurt.396 I think he something easy to use especially for older people 1176.15 1178.93 ES2007b.D.spurt.462 A button in any names again i'll i'll this can leave this up here "'cause" i'll think you know 72.88 78.17 ES2007b.A.spurt.21 Yeah and uh a mute button 760.93 762.97 ES2007b.C.spurt.283
C: Um i think it has to be only only solar energy but i don't know 339.32 342.53 ES2007c.C.spurt.122 And that's we don't care if it's from rubber or not but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material 566.83 573.64 ES2007c.B.spurt.211 It's the it's the fact that you press the same doing the same movement It's not actually what you're doing 924.76 930.09 ES2007c.A.spurt.364 And if we choosing a um 424.26 425.88 ES2007c.B.spurt.150
D: Yeah after this fat of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be cool cool remote you know or not 1011.77 1017.64 ES2007d.C.spurt.489 I'm right handed one and i left and this one 176.33 178.4 ES2007d.A.spurt.96 And i left and it's is it is yeah 189.25 191.42 ES2007d.A.spurt.105 Yeah no i know people who have left handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer 205.61 211.83 ES2007d.B.spurt.112
A: We want one remote that maybe to work uh 720.62 723.08 ES2007a.C.spurt.257 Remote with 732.79 733.46 ES2007a.C.spurt.263 Into one so it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together by making them thinner 817.49 823.22 ES2007a.D.spurt.299 Yeah that's true maybe we should just concentrate on having it at the t. v. remote can have it be 961.27 965.24 ES2007a.C.spurt.353
B: With buttons 1293.48 1294.45 ES2007b.D.spurt.505 Like just that around a lot button could be p. r. r. logo all colours and 1610.23 1615.54 ES2007b.B.spurt.639 Batteries i dunno what they call a lot Sex or something like that 371.73 375.05 ES2007b.B.spurt.152 Is a battery like 475.77 477.27 ES2007b.D.spurt.191
C: You know there's some "'cause" then i wouldn't i wouldn't have that she's an uh pictures how many people choose that or 1969.31 1974.53 ES2007c.B.spurt.813 But um for the simple buttons 878.73 880.3 ES2007c.A.spurt.345 We've got a form of all double double i 555.25 557.98 ES2007c.A.spurt.203 I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or 914.82 917.4 ES2007c.B.spurt.361
D: Imagine it did it with your left hand i don't think it's too 231.4 234.67 ES2007d.B.spurt.121 But if we make a right handed or left hand it then 665.31 667.53 ES2007d.D.spurt.325 If we're gonna have one left in it a one i had i dunno give it a one but otherwise otherwise it in 670.12 674.49 ES2007d.C.spurt.326 Play-doh as edible you know that 4.1 5.65 ES2007d.A.spurt.1
A: So to find a niche for our remote the market it to a certain 988.87 991.62 ES2007a.C.spurt.364 Yeah "'cause" at the end of the day if it's a it's just t. v. remote doesn't say come combination with all over 1015.81 1021.33 ES2007a.B.spurt.378 In a remote 1164.98 1165.58 ES2007a.D.spurt.459 See what people want in a remote 1180.09 1181.68 ES2007a.A.spurt.470
B: I think changing your batteries once every six months it's not really a pain but 501.86 506.48 ES2007b.B.spurt.206 Energy source to be batteries 1423.32 1425.37 ES2007b.A.spurt.557 Yeah this function f. eight or something 9.61 11.14 ES2007b.C.spurt.2 That has their favourite functionalities 728.78 730.96 ES2007b.C.spurt.271
C: But also using some solar power 327.71 329.21 ES2007c.C.spurt.118 Disappear it is immediately kind of fact our next paycheck or is that 2223.73 2227.58 ES2007c.C.spurt.907 We should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense i mean have something that's little more technologically advanced and what's on the market 1399.17 1405.71 ES2007c.C.spurt.554 From you can estimate you you you you know you're gonna be working on the look-and-feel design 2004.48 2009.66 ES2007c.A.spurt.824
D: It's definitely 6.69 7.79 ES2007d.A.spurt.2 Because kids 7.89 8.84 ES2007d.D.spurt.3 I used to you to 8.84 9.79 ES2007d.B.spurt.4 I have a definite you know the phone and now is edible 8.88 12.15 ES2007d.C.spurt.5
A: Mm 4.27 4.3 ES2007a.C.spurt.1 Uh-huh 7.48 7.89 ES2007a.A.spurt.2 Mm 13.81 13.88 ES2007a.C.spurt.3 Okay 21.27 21.69 ES2007a.A.spurt.4
B: Provide a lot of functionality that can be a little bit overwhelming so user centre once you should focus on ease of use 835.06 840.39 ES2007b.C.spurt.315 Functional 877.84 878.55 ES2007b.A.spurt.335 marking functionality 893.14 894.16 ES2007b.C.spurt.343 Yeah then you said to do function f. eight and should come 1030.12 1032.93 ES2007b.C.spurt.399
C: Channel five and a chance like to talk to it can i have ten of power i have 821.14 825.7 ES2007c.D.spurt.317 Ah what's find out what channel 1645.48 1647.06 ES2007c.A.spurt.666 Like you know lime green or bright yellow or bright pink or make it different colours so that anybody can see like 1813.62 1820.5 ES2007c.D.spurt.751 something for the elderly where the remote very large and the buttons are very large there's only few buttons 1096.15 1100.8 ES2007c.C.spurt.429
D: Yeah 9.41 9.71 ES2007d.D.spurt.6 Yeah 13.31 13.51 ES2007d.C.spurt.7 But um it's it's made edible "'cause" yeah 13.37 15.93 ES2007d.D.spurt.8 Is is to prove 13.88 15.25 ES2007d.A.spurt.9
A: Okay 22.87 23.07 ES2007a.C.spurt.5 Okay 24.02 24.18 ES2007a.C.spurt.6 Ooh 32.33 33.11 ES2007a.A.spurt.7 Uh 34.61 35.3 ES2007a.D.spurt.8
B: Function f. eight 1036.0 1037.24 ES2007b.D.spurt.401 the chip will be controlled by the user interface 416.08 420.33 ES2007b.B.spurt.167 One question i have i don't know how much control we have over this is 510.29 513.45 ES2007b.C.spurt.210 Um as far as the infra-red signal do we have control over 513.92 516.93 ES2007b.C.spurt.211
C: Yeah we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator 1603.76 1608.67 ES2007c.C.spurt.645 Oh push buttons instead of the wheel 537.85 540.56 ES2007c.A.spurt.197 All you can new solar cells well i'm not sure about buying do was really but 317.48 322.2 ES2007c.B.spurt.115 And to buy the t. v. programmes got one navy of watching imagine that we obtain just lost again "'cause" it costs very little panels off the wall okay 453.66 461.53 ES2007c.A.spurt.163
D: To make the double "'cause" conceded and if this was an edible them 16.91 19.97 ES2007d.D.spurt.10 Yeah 18.52 18.79 ES2007d.A.spurt.11 Well no more babies 21.18 22.62 ES2007d.D.spurt.12 I see that makes sense because i remember like 22.09 24.02 ES2007d.C.spurt.13
A: So okay on the call 36.22 37.57 ES2007a.B.spurt.9 Or 38.51 38.91 ES2007a.B.spurt.10 No i don't know it but it "'cause" then 40.09 41.86 ES2007a.B.spurt.11 Okay 43.91 44.63 ES2007a.B.spurt.12
B: so the things that seem like absolute must have this uh would be a volume control 743.25 748.12 ES2007b.C.spurt.278 I was gonna do a powerpoint presentation 18.33 20.21 ES2007b.B.spurt.7 And i have some presentations from all three of you what you've been working on For the last 173.7 178.57 ES2007b.A.spurt.72 If you're gonna give is that a little presentation 193.62 196.1 ES2007b.A.spurt.76

B: Now come back to the uh industrial design of it 1403.69 1406.85 ES2007b.A.spurt.550 we we need to find out what what people want 847.71 849.74 ES2007b.C.spurt.320 Most of to get lost in the room so and then we can find them 1158.3 1160.99 ES2007b.D.spurt.451 And it's easy to find it so i don't know whether maybe and also 1186.19 1191.83 ES2007b.D.spurt.467
C: Chip on print 646.94 647.84 ES2007c.A.spurt.236 What alternatives do we have to the chip on print 690.69 693.17 ES2007c.A.spurt.255 Calls it 2150.2 2150.74 ES2007c.A.spurt.875 And then you can market it never have to change the battery again that 1580.61 1584.31 ES2007c.D.spurt.633
D: It's pretty exciting 56.06 57.08 ES2007d.C.spurt.30 So 57.67 58.24 ES2007d.C.spurt.31 Everything that that we wanna do we want it to be ergonomic and to be 59.9 63.77 ES2007d.C.spurt.32 A lot of rubber 64.67 65.54 ES2007d.C.spurt.33

C: So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case 513.75 517.66 ES2007c.B.spurt.189 Rubber uh we'll we'll go we'll like that idea you think you can market that 472.29 476.54 ES2007c.A.spurt.171 It's been done for watches of a problem see and that for remote yet 1574.26 1578.99 ES2007c.B.spurt.629 Really different colours basically i guess i i thought i i used to run well what this f. d. a. with them at eight 1786.84 1792.79 ES2007c.D.spurt.738
D: Double curved 67.99 68.91 ES2007d.B.spurt.35 Yeah double curved um 69.71 71.82 ES2007d.C.spurt.36 Nice 69.85 70.57 ES2007d.A.spurt.37 but also something that was gonna do about people something to be different uh 71.82 76.44 ES2007d.C.spurt.38
A: Okay 135.94 136.49 ES2007a.A.spurt.33 Mm 142.21 142.76 ES2007a.A.spurt.34 Okay 148.95 149.71 ES2007a.A.spurt.35 just hang on a second have about a 149.71 151.58 ES2007a.A.spurt.36
B: To tell it to you switch on or switch channels 434.51 438.15 ES2007b.B.spurt.173 Uh channel keys up down but that also numerical keypad so that they can 752.67 756.84 ES2007b.C.spurt.281 You ski directly to the channel that they want rather than going up down 757.3 760.33 ES2007b.C.spurt.282 Is is running or five channels 1124.93 1126.44 ES2007b.A.spurt.433
C: Well in the speaker for the remote control unit 752.49 754.9 ES2007c.A.spurt.286 Do we should think uh with people so they remote controls about because it charges itself out what they're in it 1594.48 1599.38 ES2007c.A.spurt.639 Remote controls that like the look-and-feel of the car ones and 1666.16 1669.98 ES2007c.D.spurt.681 Yes the remote control to mark but if i 1860.2 1863.12 ES2007c.A.spurt.771
D: Separated from the other 76.9 78.06 ES2007d.C.spurt.39 So uh 80.56 81.65 ES2007d.C.spurt.41 You'll see what a nice thing we have gone yeah 84.89 86.65 ES2007d.C.spurt.43 I 87.03 87.63 ES2007d.A.spurt.44

B: I think that's flicking quickly between channels 1137.93 1141.18 ES2007b.A.spurt.441 Yeah you wanna navigate the channels quickly i guess 1141.57 1143.7 ES2007b.C.spurt.442 No we don't wanna do something that's too radical the change i guess i mean people want a remote that's familiar 723.52 727.73 ES2007b.C.spurt.270 Two types of remotes ones that are engineering centred in ones that are more user centred 781.54 785.76 ES2007b.C.spurt.292
C: So like you walk in a like a like a remote control because the brand then 1935.19 1938.63 ES2007c.D.spurt.802 Don't have any other remote controls are the main uh this stuff 2134.21 2137.08 ES2007c.A.spurt.871 Yeah i'm fine with the basic battery 842.61 844.36 ES2007c.C.spurt.328 Basic battery Just shape cheerful it's worked Doesn't work 844.39 848.77 ES2007c.A.spurt.329
D: That is cool 87.9 88.68 ES2007d.D.spurt.45 So basically 89.69 90.58 ES2007d.C.spurt.46 If you hold it like that 92.6 93.67 ES2007d.C.spurt.47 The one on your thumb 94.56 95.55 ES2007d.C.spurt.48

B: Looking at whether to use maybe infrared all bluetooth 1408.95 1412.62 ES2007b.A.spurt.552 I think 1413.65 1414.2 ES2007b.A.spurt.553 We should just go with the simplest 1414.99 1416.83 ES2007b.A.spurt.554 Option on everything 1417.58 1419.56 ES2007b.A.spurt.555
C: Uh 1174.71 1175.17 ES2007c.C.spurt.462 so was against the speech recognition and against 1175.17 1177.37 ES2007c.C.spurt.463 Going uh 1177.85 1178.69 ES2007c.C.spurt.464 it was in your thing and And then each sense i think it should be more general 1178.69 1182.29 ES2007c.C.spurt.465
D: Well 1187.94 1188.42 ES2007d.D.spurt.563 Yeah 1188.71 1189.06 ES2007d.A.spurt.564 But the uh i'd i'd mm that yeah as you said uh we are not 1193.04 1196.41 ES2007d.A.spurt.565 Never seen that before yeah 1197.06 1199.01 ES2007d.A.spurt.566
B: Uh and that would be infrared 1420.51 1422.64 ES2007b.A.spurt.556 Um 1433.97 1434.67 ES2007b.A.spurt.559 But uh in this know but i mean is any point in 1437.34 1439.79 ES2007b.A.spurt.560 Mm 1450.59 1450.68 ES2007b.A.spurt.562
C: And i don't think the spinning wheel with the uh l. c. display or 1182.83 1185.98 ES2007c.C.spurt.466 Or crucial for us 1186.75 1187.81 ES2007c.C.spurt.467 Yeah and yeah 1188.68 1189.6 ES2007c.C.spurt.468 That's it for me 1190.34 1191.18 ES2007c.C.spurt.469
D: So we're to 1199.6 1200.45 ES2007d.A.spurt.567 Whiteboard 1201.4 1202.23 ES2007d.A.spurt.568 Yeah 1202.7 1203.02 ES2007d.B.spurt.569 Thingy uh it's great 1203.91 1205.4 ES2007d.A.spurt.570
B: So 1451.36 1451.86 ES2007b.A.spurt.563 Nothing will um processed on that 1455.24 1457.36 ES2007b.A.spurt.564 Um 1458.73 1459.22 ES2007b.A.spurt.565 Any any questions 1460.88 1462.16 ES2007b.A.spurt.566

D: Thing i mean it's you know in such a new idea 1213.42 1216.18 ES2007d.A.spurt.572 It would be different if it was sort of 1217.43 1219.52 ES2007d.A.spurt.573 Handwriting recognition 1220.02 1221.6 ES2007d.A.spurt.574 Stuff but it's it's not a speech read 1222.37 1224.37 ES2007d.A.spurt.575

C: Cool 1315.83 1316.22 ES2007c.A.spurt.526 Right 1328.05 1328.41 ES2007c.D.spurt.527 Mark it it's 1337.6 1339.18 ES2007c.D.spurt.529 Yeah 1339.68 1340.07 ES2007c.A.spurt.530
B: Well 1543.04 1543.36 ES2007b.A.spurt.612 Getting ahead of ourselves 1543.29 1544.52 ES2007b.C.spurt.613 It would be 1544.1 1545.02 ES2007b.B.spurt.614 Maybe you can come up with a few you know a couple different ideas 1544.52 1547.36 ES2007b.A.spurt.615
C: And what fast as a for next year 1340.28 1342.87 ES2007c.D.spurt.531 Um 1344.07 1344.81 ES2007c.D.spurt.532 So yes 1346.18 1346.92 ES2007c.D.spurt.533 So from looking at this this this trends and fashions 1347.8 1350.89 ES2007c.D.spurt.534
B: But if it's a are are they would be real reaction 1559.92 1562.35 ES2007b.D.spurt.618 Like is that the symbol on it 1562.98 1564.32 ES2007b.D.spurt.619 There's a logic um least it called r. r. 1563.46 1565.94 ES2007b.A.spurt.620 Well 1566.87 1567.24 ES2007b.D.spurt.621
C: Uh-huh 1350.94 1351.34 ES2007c.A.spurt.535 These are like most important aspects that we really need to which we've already probably discussed 1360.16 1364.65 ES2007c.D.spurt.538 Um 1365.21 1366.03 ES2007c.D.spurt.539 The we already have So it has to be 1373.53 1375.79 ES2007c.D.spurt.541
B: This is slow and as but this is the slogan this is that that that that's right 1567.22 1571.47 ES2007b.A.spurt.622 Yeah 1573.59 1574.06 ES2007b.A.spurt.624 Three after that one colour 1576.49 1577.68 ES2007b.D.spurt.625 Well not necessarily but we have to incorporate it 1578.04 1580.95 ES2007b.A.spurt.626
C: Exactly 1377.83 1378.51 ES2007c.D.spurt.543 Um 1380.1 1381.04 ES2007c.D.spurt.544 seconds 1381.04 1381.72 ES2007c.D.spurt.545 Uh 1382.27 1382.67 ES2007c.D.spurt.546
