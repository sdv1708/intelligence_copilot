A: second time to the next meeting	4507.06	4509.0	EN2001a.B.spurt.229 So for example you you would spend give a high value to those And sequences you want to display in the meeting series Summary	542.85	551.77	EN2001a.B.spurt.21 Possibly reading everything was the team um load of the uh annotation stuff all the sound files sought	649.8	657.08	EN2001a.B.spurt.27 That there's times sense um for low segments	1768.69	1772.52	EN2001a.B.spurt.76
B: We can go with a script and sort of go for each segment a starting in and times and say okay this is from our time segment Features just time segment there so we take that some of those and divide them by by the number something create the average and put it in as the value for the segment	2565.2	2579.27	EN2001b.B.spurt.891 To understand enough of the data structures is pretty would be lot easier would i really as then how they have like the date and time we could make and then i could say oh it's easy to just tied in if you just take the time standard just reference by words and stuff	1284.55	1295.44	EN2001b.B.spurt.458 Well i was thinking is whether it's to replace the board buy something unique see that identifiable then it would make different which order it is but that wouldn't work because it needs to work because that's was working on is the board and it looks if that were course again and versus whole thing that border "'cause" another context right	2325.43	2339.07	EN2001b.B.spurt.826 things that are loaded every time but we have lazy loading so It can load more than that	1067.79	1074.56	EN2001b.A.spurt.383
C: Then we should fairly easily from now okay two stage where we Can like select individual segments a click on them and play that part in a compressed wait and display kinds of information	77.07	86.49	EN2001d.B.spurt.16 Displaying two types of information in the in the colour display i mean that that's pretty logically wait like if one is gonna break one is the darkness and the others the red that's uh something thing whatever experiment with what displaying two dimensional information in	2411.11	2422.53	EN2001d.B.spurt.875 But i'm not i'm not sure if it's worth much although the like if we do it as like the similarity surgeon just like you say find me similar segments and then sort of like a place and you click on one of them and then you go to that segment	972.55	982.81	EN2001d.B.spurt.340 And information about similarity to this elect elect to select the meeting in to select segment in the other segments	935.44	941.22	EN2001d.B.spurt.327
D: One standard deviation below The mean is zero and one cent of age above the mean it's one or two standard deviation or something then whatever the data is like it would always normalise	1520.98	1530.25	EN2001e.B.spurt.296 I think the display has some method for a remote that like for the problem and show them to call but if you had of cent sure what it's called the the display have some effort read it works start with and	3665.87	3674.92	EN2001e.B.spurt.842 As a proportion of fact roles of restriction like the good way of going about it because anything that absolutely and so stupid is that meets the long long segments	3905.38	3912.85	EN2001e.B.spurt.877 As i said at the moment i've hard coded to trust and taking one tenth of the number of utterances with very directional selection	878.51	886.09	EN2001e.B.spurt.178
A: Yeah the annotator has decided what was one segment and what wasn't	1822.36	1826.7	EN2001a.B.spurt.91 For some uh annotations um	1874.78	1876.95	EN2001a.B.spurt.95 Yeah everything let's to work as as tight time stamp	2714.33	2717.61	EN2001a.B.spurt.105 The time	2763.16	2763.54	EN2001a.B.spurt.108
B: For the prototype we need some type of data but to develop the data would be lot easier to	3385.58	3389.24	EN2001b.B.spurt.1183 So we can't attach some type of information to the word just about string itself like making it on the score like the time uh something that wouldn't work	2339.49	2346.32	EN2001b.B.spurt.830 we just split i need some way to split And that and starting at category boundaries are and splitting a topic non brits with a nice thing to do	2153.88	2163.85	EN2001b.C.spurt.775 Yeah but i think it's too early to really like Discuss that indeed because we don't at all understand at the moment how the internal data structure like Well the loading works so	1161.5	1170.43	EN2001b.B.spurt.417
C: Yeah no shoe is you like it we would not necessarily to be part of the final thing but why don't we just provide Some means even if it does it automatically in the beginning as as lot of options just ask for find them "'cause" then you can just published a script	1958.62	1970.04	EN2001d.B.spurt.728 so just a little bit of a additional information to display that knows for meetings buchanan over another wasn't gonna be treated it so we've continues i. d.s for the segments	867.97	876.62	EN2001d.B.spurt.304 Yeah the segments uh made up at the moment but the codes therefore In the reading real segments	127.57	131.81	EN2001d.B.spurt.34 We don't wanna confuse people we give people something simple and colourful or something is moving and whether don't have to deal with any numbers or text or anything like that for that matter in fact that's why we've given you	3184.67	3195.14	EN2001d.B.spurt.1153
D: So if you find that form an hour that would be good otherwise i can see if i can still understand like i did it in my problem is there's usually stupid like this and the standard deviation for men or	1542.27	1550.67	EN2001e.B.spurt.300 In the worst case it would just be a static sort of arrow but then the right hand couple corner of the display in you press that and then you're on the display the whole thing again but for that at the moment my display code	3056.95	3067.94	EN2001e.B.spurt.723 Display because the display is just called that selection	3739.38	3741.71	EN2001e.B.spurt.848 You could just be fruit on the laptop for a line over i mean they get the moment it's not too bad apart from i think the sound is stuttering and that's i think because the laptop	3457.88	3465.55	EN2001e.B.spurt.800
A: Didn't have a look at the meetings	2769.21	2770.48	EN2001a.B.spurt.111 Because in every meeting uh	2783.62	2785.5	EN2001a.B.spurt.114 And i think it you know it's a it's a one annotation like digits uh something so that should be very easy to	2789.35	2796.24	EN2001a.B.spurt.116 You know what it as as big get us the hot spot Annotation	3437.63	3442.31	EN2001a.B.spurt.155
B: Yes but if it's if it's in the form which is he's read in at the moment it would be fine sort of like If basically if we have something like this segments five but for each if you like just have one attribute	3397.72	3406.99	EN2001b.B.spurt.1189 If we combine them in the prototype or don't at the moment "'cause" then we can easily	3411.49	3416.01	EN2001b.B.spurt.1191 Then for um what's it called the end coffee calculation It's such a box and that's simple calculation that you could really write the script and no time at all	1661.13	1668.98	EN2001b.B.spurt.601 I was thinking if we maybe just should go through some of them and like try to see Can stand the general structure and put together what we think about structure what we think that things mean	190.59	199.72	EN2001b.B.spurt.77
C: Real time on right That's was displayed on that the ball is real time isn't it	2892.91	2897.92	EN2001d.D.spurt.1053 Well is just good practice like it separates the data for the program logic what you would would not doing is in bad things on the program logic in the data	2235.9	2243.08	EN2001d.D.spurt.812 The music files playing without gaps that's because the way how we handle that number this today if	162.62	167.51	EN2001d.B.spurt.41 User control click on that a lot actually all play that section of all i was well	196.74	200.93	EN2001d.D.spurt.54
D: So you you basically have to be have to have to code worse than one for some kind of one from um phone card machines to test it on	1657.4	1662.53	EN2001e.B.spurt.327 Yeah but last time i press that he can make everything and wrong and i think i'd be able to do just fine on the screen so that'll probably keep me from point to on my screen which are used	63.84	71.61	EN2001e.B.spurt.15 Can she can use my laptop the sort of like as a as a service That's a sound server that would that mean that we have to get the speech was running on that	3529.56	3536.89	EN2001e.B.spurt.815 And there's no simple ways is i haven't found one directly in in a single step sort of s. s. h. and then s. h. again	1376.57	1384.28	EN2001e.B.spurt.269
A: For each meeting a fire that says for from	4284.79	4287.54	EN2001a.B.spurt.179 starting time so	4367.91	4369.25	EN2001a.B.spurt.203 Yeah i mean i i have one what i'd do if you would be one fight for each meeting	4392.69	4398.17	EN2001a.B.spurt.206 Yeah not for each meeting series I didn't do that yet	4401.56	4404.43	EN2001a.B.spurt.207
B: Yeah but for a summer i may defy that contains just they um start times It could contain in times and words for us because of our meetings i mean that's just the same Thing as an a. k. if yeah as a gift to that	1370.09	1384.69	EN2001b.A.spurt.482 Are able to uh well i think that's probably back where we started Did you say to be a bit use it as you walk because it was your segment on those segments exactly	2740.55	2748.36	EN2001b.B.spurt.955 uh function was just very general announced the product was or there for example the word computer in that context You can imagine it to flag been all in all the context	1778.12	1786.92	EN2001b.B.spurt.636 Five times in the meeting and they if each time a different you know give And and so on where it's perhaps it's not enough data	1801.2	1809.18	EN2001b.A.spurt.640
C: Code or whatever codes for this components and see if we can access	3070.96	3074.32	EN2001d.B.spurt.1115 Or would still like would be still in the logic of it still have continues i. d.s if it's a bit take it just	2257.25	2262.98	EN2001d.B.spurt.817 Do i tell you we've got calling that a way traction if you control like not should still play There should be in the phone	56.76	63.18	EN2001d.D.spurt.11 "'cause" and a lot but if you would be that you could sort of make it it always is the same length so if you like if the whole meeting is selected compress the whole meeting to five minutes Then if one	495.72	505.59	EN2001d.B.spurt.174
D: But i think like about purported a one is probably not bad idea that's plumbing than an absolute link the sort of a bit strange "'cause" that means that some utterances will not be changed link and we we had a discussion before and i'm confused with a couple of what the thing about it so the fact that this is going on the on the green line here	899.89	914.71	EN2001e.B.spurt.182 So this is when you start shifting around your laptop you think they'd get some uh less slope on the screen	195.46	200.16	EN2001e.B.spurt.45 Yeah it does get to summarise just that's just a summarising stupid you but at least it's chomping	623.18	627.36	EN2001e.B.spurt.124 It's doing different things all the time like this the first time directly	50.84	53.48	EN2001e.B.spurt.13
A: Yeah i mean that's one sears but that's just one meeting	4434.01	4436.69	EN2001a.B.spurt.211 they used that as tight times	4495.63	4497.75	EN2001a.B.spurt.222 For each meeting at zero you could just	4499.97	4502.43	EN2001a.B.spurt.225 start and end time	4543.4	4544.36	EN2001a.B.spurt.239
B: But i mean it can't be that difficult if you if you already have You have in the right order all the words with the with the score to them you have a file which has each word and the time stamp	1471.12	1480.91	EN2001b.B.spurt.521 But it as as the first step that's probably For for a prototype for next week this program a bad thing i mean even if it's just a t. v. just like if you have segments we were lots of rare birds the core of highlighted in dark a red and segments for all the very common words occur	2421.43	2435.04	EN2001b.B.spurt.853 And then it would be easy to then go back one if you have the time marks here And we map it onto onto the length of segment you know what i mean	2524.77	2531.7	EN2001b.B.spurt.880 And that you could load into a prototype and See what types of disk	3017.85	3021.85	EN2001b.B.spurt.1050
C: That should be fairly to do the right if i just dollars plane you make a a like a normal thing top second dialogue acts	3045.53	3051.74	EN2001d.B.spurt.1108 And we don't have to accept all your record for this usually standard of just copied it to just to show they've just put uh uh a music find in there	153.28	160.85	EN2001d.B.spurt.39 Okay this is a summarisation down to one segment and it would just be less like this and you click on one and then	1015.44	1020.78	EN2001d.B.spurt.348 Is that if you if you think about how the old version have and then you see it makes sense that words like prosody just like a single if that was the only utterance That that probably score quite well and stuff	379.76	389.4	EN2001d.B.spurt.138
D: I found some stuff a lot on the web and it should look to me like proper coding like I saw half page cool samples which effectively just	3216.39	3223.69	EN2001e.B.spurt.751 Yeah so it's like the values of hard coded for the screen sizes and by some transcripts more	757.73	762.62	EN2001e.B.spurt.158 Okay we have uh a that's a good one of my display was just think my display can't handle displaying	3081.04	3085.21	EN2001e.B.spurt.727 Yeah i think it would be good data you could could couldn't the display to annotate them a display if we can	1827.08	1832.05	EN2001e.B.spurt.381
A: Um for um meeting series	4629.58	4631.73	EN2001a.B.spurt.253 Um are test at times	4685.34	4686.9	EN2001a.B.spurt.265 for all the corpus as just from what i know from i attended some time and um i i buy it	4728.75	4733.95	EN2001a.B.spurt.273 all the words together um for all the meetings	4743.13	4745.89	EN2001a.B.spurt.278
B: Yeah i think we would have To have the same structure one that plans to wear a tie it together all information	881.11	887.65	EN2001b.A.spurt.324 It loads to hold of the second find every time	1109.35	1111.54	EN2001b.B.spurt.399 Segment in here or a touch it actually came in a tight to the segments find would that not be the way how they would want to have to do it if we in the end you want to attach each of those segments	925.46	934.95	EN2001b.B.spurt.341 Yeah so does anyone have a good idea where to start like which works so what is it be talking what getting in at the moment we basically just "'cause" the two of you would much data together right	272.47	281.35	EN2001b.B.spurt.112
C: Like it's really i mean like i dunno if you want to go for the simple things discrete three scripts	2873.55	2877.91	EN2001d.B.spurt.1047 Yes uh from here we go in and hopefully won't be too difficult in our first of all put the right segments and put a sliding bar into this so that people see where they are	439.35	446.68	EN2001d.B.spurt.158 That would just create like hot segments at the start and end of each meeting like once uh red and so that black or something like that	859.3	866.25	EN2001d.D.spurt.302 Um that's simply There's one button that says find similar segments	918.62	922.74	EN2001d.B.spurt.321
D: Does anyone know anything about which dice machines have some cards and how to find them	1627.13	1632.32	EN2001e.B.spurt.318 Yeah so maybe it's just like maybe but she's good to have like some generic component with three side or something where we can relatively easy add a fourth one or something you know I'm just like sort of all i'll fiddle factors	2144.86	2155.2	EN2001e.B.spurt.482 The most professional way of doing it would be to map them according to the standard deviation "'cause" that would would automatically always	1475.69	1481.93	EN2001e.B.spurt.289 That sort of like it it's the problem is it's more calculation expensive and slight smoke on occasion that's okay i can come to a place that's not much to be able like you know general about standard deviation	1483.01	1491.91	EN2001e.B.spurt.290
A: Just one fire off first meeting um	4831.68	4834.86	EN2001a.B.spurt.294 Yeah i mean if it's just for one meeting it's really not to be	4844.4	4847.25	EN2001a.B.spurt.296 Yeah	78.8	79.15	EN2001a.B.spurt.1 I mean we if we	84.39	85.65	EN2001a.B.spurt.2
B: And then we'd have to go back again and then put that back into that segment on here	2714.93	2718.99	EN2001b.B.spurt.944 But boards that doesn't always just to know is is referencing to several Words options so this would be basically be uh	774.96	780.95	EN2001b.B.spurt.285 Can tie in their stuff as you would have all how it looks like a hard to forms you know that problem makes it a lot easier than that so if it's a bootstrapping problem like	3377.66	3384.94	EN2001b.B.spurt.1182 So yeah that's quite easy because it's it's a an attribute and you just say that you want the various of those attributes	2975.64	2983.19	EN2001b.C.spurt.1038
C: So so something like this keeping would've actually corporate with a system at the moment put our skip automatically for work	1345.19	1351.39	EN2001d.B.spurt.495 Some part of the meeting so we're we're not loading the whole thing at the moment it properly of important thing is this is some rights based on	136.89	144.73	EN2001d.B.spurt.36 Each of them sort of giving whatever We should aim to get some names for segments that says some extraction of something that you can call this is just a single highest um	999.46	1009.61	EN2001d.B.spurt.346 Importance matter what phrase of a segment so that if something to display for them	1010.36	1014.78	EN2001d.B.spurt.347
D: Dave i think actually that the summary at the current moment isn't working hundred percent correct but that could be because of the input data it seems to just take the first	150.84	159.64	EN2001e.B.spurt.34 Is basis since i've just switched them around anyway but that's o. k. i. by the way i read a paper which makes an important point about combining two things of that type um it's basically it's just going all about this fancy can go geometric mean which effectively just means but applying them	654.21	669.89	EN2001e.B.spurt.131 In an arbitrary way in In in swing graphic displays know very simple ways of doing two trips over a team elements like if if uh but me just give it a two two packs but The reason means of doing to just to just like i put a mouse over	3138.85	3151.62	EN2001e.B.spurt.740 For the displayed should make much difference "'cause" i think everything in the display code is just from the first on to the last	2971.89	2977.05	EN2001e.B.spurt.711
A: Just want to have	86.23	87.36	EN2001a.B.spurt.3 Um	87.73	88.33	EN2001a.B.spurt.4 some data or four uh we use the phase could even be random data	88.33	92.9	EN2001a.B.spurt.5 Yeah	103.97	104.59	EN2001a.B.spurt.6
B: a typical for one category it will assign It's a bad category and if that's typical for another one that will send it to that one	1578.79	1587.0	EN2001b.C.spurt.562 And then it only it starts at a later time because uh you can see when i'm pointing is which is true that so then it starts here this coming in speaker d. because in between the somebody else	833.13	841.15	EN2001b.B.spurt.308 What's forming a while but you context measures yeah	1745.73	1748.98	EN2001b.A.spurt.627 The file with annotations for Information then see what would that be like would that be like the segments file giving a start More than in word or	861.38	870.2	EN2001b.B.spurt.319
C: Yes a fairly i don't mind words time so if the data manager features that are gonna like	2183.79	2188.25	EN2001d.B.spurt.801 I think the simple The simple to use that we get that you can just like	1383.7	1387.87	EN2001d.B.spurt.508 With the moving but it's not a good idea but Until i think of something better what i just do is i just A problem have a moving but the whole length just some indicator somewhere like	1568.56	1577.2	EN2001d.B.spurt.571 And the selection moves and the display goes to the park	1093.82	1096.2	EN2001d.B.spurt.376
D: so i think they've really easy to it if we just make a sound card and on sound card version of it because	1698.24	1702.78	EN2001e.B.spurt.344 And was taking on this segment beeper we have to make a segment lot a lot bigger so then i i take it in you summarisation yet and if you see so the kinetic to get a different one yeah so you see it's a different text	768.85	778.7	EN2001e.B.spurt.160 In a summarise section and the actor tandem correspondent stuff and we found was some stupid	17.74	22.16	EN2001e.B.spurt.5 As a rubber i was from i was think it's exact the same thing that happened to be say set selection it's not like you said selection does everything you want sort of	3720.79	3728.41	EN2001e.B.spurt.845
A: Mm	253.04	253.44	EN2001a.B.spurt.7 Yes	406.36	406.87	EN2001a.B.spurt.8 Mm yes	461.27	461.78	EN2001a.B.spurt.9 And so	495.69	496.29	EN2001a.B.spurt.10
B: Uh displaying also start and end times of the remote So you could perhaps user to match um	1386.55	1392.31	EN2001b.A.spurt.486 Well i guess i mean for you if you will know for each word if you find that out then it has to be possible because if we know so if this is going from work to work or is this going from time to time and then	2796.45	2806.46	EN2001b.B.spurt.976 Would it be easy though because all your methods a sort of not working with their whole time for instruction uh so would it be easy for you to	1196.14	1201.82	EN2001b.B.spurt.427 But your category thing depends on that we watch is the topic segments but also that these topic segments we have to make categories	1915.41	1921.76	EN2001b.B.spurt.684
C: If anything you build in a time bomb to do and you feel so is that data's the defeat of the presentation	1268.77	1273.73	EN2001d.B.spurt.465 Yeah i think that's what we should do so they think it's probably an easy task to read that great But only more difficult to get any band automatically when it's changed so that's why we might have to extend back talking like overwrite the function that react to that	3090.04	3102.94	EN2001d.B.spurt.1121 The thing of like i have to find out how to do it without redrawing the display each time because the display at the moment	1545.5	1551.14	EN2001d.B.spurt.566 Still put just be starting stuff then "'cause" all be starting yeah	1843.51	1846.91	EN2001d.D.spurt.682
D: If you introduce um like a sort of us tactic What's it called public start again so basically constant like that so so the content of the names texas euro t. v. i. d. f.	2328.13	2338.11	EN2001e.B.spurt.543 Yeah you know what the thing is the display course methods probably	3597.98	3601.57	EN2001e.B.spurt.829 Yeah and i think the display has method for that ready	3779.92	3782.47	EN2001e.B.spurt.854 Um so i run it on all the b. b. b. m. r. and b. are all meetings to run it	1977.65	1983.98	EN2001e.A.spurt.416
A: I i thought we would just have like um	511.51	514.57	EN2001a.B.spurt.11 one big salary	514.57	516.21	EN2001a.B.spurt.12 Um	516.59	517.0	EN2001a.B.spurt.13 well only uh different importance level it's um	517.0	520.64	EN2001a.B.spurt.14
B: With that thing you would easily have an average which at the moment provides you for each word With the score which we can use	1842.35	1848.54	EN2001b.B.spurt.650 Topic segments which Is some measure already of how widespread this for those forces how specific for certain Segment that is	2252.66	2260.75	EN2001b.B.spurt.803 The matrix bit of of the document i worked stuff It's very easy to the antarctic for each word The score and i can just if you those course you can do but then whatever you want	3275.3	3284.12	EN2001b.B.spurt.1152 I think an interesting thing is if we don't combine your to scores in the uh	2816.02	2820.65	EN2001b.B.spurt.981
C: So basically this display would have information about	1045.16	1047.39	EN2001d.B.spurt.358 In mind would give to start segment i. d.s	1038.97	1040.88	EN2001d.B.spurt.356 We need the explicit information about it Each meeting then like the one from each utterance which uh the current goes and stuff	2556.55	2562.94	EN2001d.B.spurt.930 Have you currently got continuous i. d.s for a topic segments	2279.82	2284.28	EN2001d.C.spurt.824
D: As you know what i have to go there anyway and put "'em" Piece of paper and machines were some stuff like that running on	3263.75	3268.72	EN2001e.B.spurt.759 That's it would have to get the speech to training on my laptop that would be	3447.07	3450.14	EN2001e.B.spurt.798 And if you that would require that you have all your key five set correctly which i haven't "'cause" it always tracks of my system maybe if you get that working they should be able to directly going to another machine	1396.38	1405.74	EN2001e.B.spurt.271 You would forget that that means that you would start at fifteen times over here fifteen zombies running	1619.34	1623.84	EN2001e.B.spurt.314
A: Displayed on it and	521.5	522.91	EN2001a.B.spurt.15 Depending on what our um	523.37	525.92	EN2001a.B.spurt.16 there's another this we just display a part of it	525.92	528.38	EN2001a.B.spurt.17 And we would have one very big Thing off line	531.77	535.15	EN2001a.B.spurt.18
B: Display them individually contrast and each other and play around with how you to combine them	3416.61	3421.7	EN2001b.B.spurt.1192 Yeah i'm also bit like i'm a lot of some trouble rainbow being the right thing "'cause" it seems the green bolt that's it it's structure part relied having different	2171.2	2178.99	EN2001b.B.spurt.783 So if we if we if for each one second time slot we could attach value	2520.55	2524.35	EN2001b.B.spurt.879 You then tie it back in into the right segment here mean	1206.99	1209.86	EN2001b.B.spurt.429
C: A two scripts Which load a parameter uh common learn from it which is which fights about it and and then it's just there	2878.76	2885.12	EN2001d.B.spurt.1048 adjustments we're gonna wear a script and they each can load that stuff and see the annotator in	3031.61	3036.62	EN2001d.B.spurt.1104 So what kind of change will impose on the summarisation because if we find you know	3204.69	3209.28	EN2001d.C.spurt.1156 Yeah that's the point of the data manager is to manage all that	2142.57	2145.57	EN2001d.D.spurt.785
D: See that probably just mean to the display sort of tests an internal knowledge about what level of so maybe yeah so initially the display	3013.16	3020.22	EN2001e.B.spurt.715 Yes and in fact at the moment even know which of that too um summarising over you know you are we are we	629.85	634.67	EN2001e.B.spurt.125 Hi in it simple important rating But it's just sort of Then everything else we need to talk the first ones	1450.4	1456.85	EN2001e.B.spurt.285 Tentatively there's always the method of just giving it a really high score is a half you know it just	3826.41	3831.75	EN2001e.B.spurt.861
A: And from that you would just select what we are displaying	535.93	538.59	EN2001a.B.spurt.19 Yes	542.02	542.43	EN2001a.B.spurt.20 And you just cut off	552.75	554.06	EN2001a.B.spurt.22 That was what i show us a lot yeah	566.05	568.17	EN2001a.B.spurt.23
B: Have the highest information for one category so it's the categories of course each other think	1450.56	1457.17	EN2001b.C.spurt.511 Um i mean i just calculated the way you as they use for um the average f. c. euros	3036.19	3042.52	EN2001b.A.spurt.1055 Yeah the average of six speakers and they measured every whole point oh one six seconds	3131.38	3137.34	EN2001b.A.spurt.1090 Well basically the score that until what is conditions land for peace corps which just checks how much information	1717.12	1722.43	EN2001b.B.spurt.618
C: Like it into how sort of top off one the bottom half feel uh	2811.97	2815.54	EN2001d.D.spurt.1023 Second uh one topic is selected and it place this whole topic in five minutes	507.61	511.79	EN2001d.B.spurt.177 What's that should discuss for today there were such required for today	528.91	532.18	EN2001d.B.spurt.183 This is rating do we have any direct control to that or is that just directly controlling how fast the place and sort of	1281.31	1287.01	EN2001d.B.spurt.470
D: O. k. you want to have a look at the agreement and disagreement data that they worked on last week or do we have anything more on	1774.38	1782.71	EN2001e.A.spurt.361 So if you had time to change brought to medically put the position the display in the right okay	3759.72	3763.94	EN2001e.B.spurt.850 "'cause" i think i mean d. or do you use "'em" in the in the audience a very important component of it	1266.27	1270.55	EN2001e.B.spurt.250 Word importance file is test three m. t. v. i. d. f. i just have to have just i just switched them around have no clue what grade did you get the moment	642.6	649.58	EN2001e.B.spurt.129
A: I think them a difference might be that we wouldn't task want to have um	639.63	644.41	EN2001a.B.spurt.24 the words and that's not so much	644.41	646.86	EN2001a.B.spurt.25 What you meant was not	647.4	648.91	EN2001a.B.spurt.26 I i i'm getting quite lost	717.43	719.13	EN2001a.B.spurt.28
B: Maybe if we if you go ahead do you think it would be possible for you to do and like something like segment or maybe just a copy of segments which has an attribute for For each segment	1171.27	1180.19	EN2001b.B.spurt.418 So you also have family which can be tight time to time	2545.21	2547.83	EN2001b.B.spurt.885 You could and that granularity create a score	2787.56	2790.43	EN2001b.B.spurt.973 I don't know in which five the actual but what's it called the splitting into the utterances	469.5	474.1	EN2001b.B.spurt.184
C: So at the moment we have a dialogue act window	93.83	96.12	EN2001d.B.spurt.20 So you or data manager would that can handle the whole thing would that And that that this for the only that the display would only display One group	2173.54	2181.18	EN2001d.B.spurt.799 Mm well half dozen usually have music that haitian she's	1878.36	1881.79	EN2001d.D.spurt.695 A simple summary	1450.67	1451.91	EN2001d.B.spurt.533
D: Yes "'cause" i was just i was just check you know like how far apart are they at the moment uh steph did not a good thing to display if they are	2531.66	2538.07	EN2001e.B.spurt.604 That should be i mean i didn't in efficiently and effectively sort of go through all the segments and check if they kicked on that	1841.7	1847.69	EN2001e.B.spurt.385 Gets to one percent of its think than other one gets to exactly it's in and stuff so if we doing it uh proportion than just having one points here or something	3913.54	3920.96	EN2001e.B.spurt.878 How much is not go for the last question "'cause" you see the last question some things half the time and it's a five percent	3294.99	3299.66	EN2001e.B.spurt.767
A: Um i do want because um	719.49	721.24	EN2001a.B.spurt.29 what's	721.24	721.73	EN2001a.B.spurt.30 Um our difference between a um	722.17	724.51	EN2001a.B.spurt.31 set um	724.51	725.27	EN2001a.B.spurt.32
B: I know that i don't have access to because they didn't on it like this is one that information fibre describes the structure for the files and Describe switch um	1012.0	1020.39	EN2001b.B.spurt.366 To me that i'm writing and i agree with that which then tries to also again based on board or current actions try to linked together	2113.57	2119.96	EN2001b.B.spurt.761 On the board like on	2322.52	2323.65	EN2001b.B.spurt.825 So those two tie together have each word and it's time and	1482.13	1485.14	EN2001b.B.spurt.523
C: Yeah and especially the creepy will be able to get to to fairly simple "'cause" it's just a property of it	1499.53	1504.15	EN2001d.B.spurt.552 It's wait a minute complains about	398.7	400.89	EN2001d.D.spurt.143 I have some code for system calls	735.38	738.48	EN2001d.B.spurt.261 The only d.s can get some stuff in the model is I mean so you have to read through the list of options is when you compiling all the data over and over and over and over again	2070.86	2079.71	EN2001d.D.spurt.763
D: If we just write a program the way that you mean the way to display set everything it still leaves those are like you think if those a special information than steady or if you just put a spell	510.43	519.76	EN2001e.B.spurt.110 I think it's quite beautiful it's like if you want to programme only to round ones that only a part of it you don't worry if it crashed alpha with with waste all the resources before what's the hard disk and yeah	1599.57	1608.21	EN2001e.B.spurt.309 Making the summary then i think generally proportion like that so	3900.96	3904.58	EN2001e.B.spurt.876 But this is not ideal at the moment david these little bit or running with make it	740.25	743.93	EN2001e.B.spurt.152
A: Yeah it they importance matter sure And the east giving i mean to read to both i was at the same thing	726.13	733.39	EN2001a.B.spurt.33 Okay	737.23	737.63	EN2001a.B.spurt.34 So but when when we talk about summary should talk about this Oh about about skimming and not the ball	738.94	745.29	EN2001a.B.spurt.35 Yeah	762.51	762.79	EN2001a.B.spurt.36
B: Times and and tie things together	2955.51	2957.71	EN2001b.B.spurt.1032 i always store The big is that an end time Well everything a calculator there so	1223.29	1229.32	EN2001b.A.spurt.437 Did you have to something like just like not measuring this year idiap to low budget like the variance of us are within a certain time frame and like sort of like just have some part for it's Very low whereas with them or as top of the semester and one where there's a lot of all the current	3089.81	3103.31	EN2001b.B.spurt.1073 So the only thing we are trying to tie in this just an additional annotation which is similar to	286.21	292.11	EN2001b.B.spurt.115
C: I was a bit pissed off yesterday about that part because it was not just like a decision be taken say okay we can talk about evaluation of the in the first report there's nothing you we can say about it this time and i thought he said that in the meeting before wrote the report and then he came back to this look at this isn't saying like uh you didn't say anything about it um aberration and	1728.66	1745.51	EN2001d.B.spurt.627 i completely agree so the only thing it would be that the display gets information about where they are in this place them i thought andreas	890.68	897.43	EN2001d.B.spurt.313 and then maybe have some Basic information like if	853.72	857.63	EN2001d.B.spurt.301 Running along with the playing	185.57	187.04	EN2001d.B.spurt.48
D: The machine that like the on the only gateway machines	1370.3	1373.12	EN2001e.B.spurt.267 And we can probably just like sort of started up before the presentation starts so in case we shouldn't it all be bored or what	1592.8	1598.8	EN2001e.B.spurt.308 But i'm colour i'm going about in power now and i have mixed on the hard disk so i can	3241.33	3245.1	EN2001e.B.spurt.755 But but but that all relies on finding some way of getting the speech tools to do that shop	3496.28	3501.37	EN2001e.B.spurt.810
A: Yeah it isn't that this country	766.8	768.22	EN2001a.B.spurt.37 Isn't that this can	769.01	770.08	EN2001a.B.spurt.38 Yeah but it to the same data	774.24	775.88	EN2001a.B.spurt.39 And yeah i think we also thought about combining that matter was um	855.27	860.6	EN2001a.B.spurt.40
B: Split super or a Because everything you doing in in one way or the other be type type on to action time	2513.15	2519.65	EN2001b.B.spurt.878 Goes back to state day in the right order still and stuff right so that shouldn't be a problem	1354.98	1358.62	EN2001b.B.spurt.477 One word every time i mean for for a specific word	1872.64	1875.55	EN2001b.A.spurt.662 and you have several categories and then it measures	1558.24	1561.43	EN2001b.C.spurt.550
C: Okay but like so make it an option which one it displays so which one it uses for the summarisation or	2761.91	2767.2	EN2001d.B.spurt.1008 I just think that in the in the logic of the program it's it's much easier to justify why we say be treated	2189.77	2194.14	EN2001d.B.spurt.802 You so that that's what i was thinking that that's the second meeting just continue to the first one spot and for one group that's true because it's sort of like the meetings in uh like that one meeting and uh	2093.06	2101.08	EN2001d.B.spurt.772 That you just run and then this whole thing starts	1971.03	1973.11	EN2001d.B.spurt.729
D: I think it's a good idea to run the speech too it's in	3508.55	3512.45	EN2001e.B.spurt.812 It's from crash and just crashed i think she's there If we just kept on playing and uh reach some	2672.8	2678.59	EN2001e.B.spurt.647 sure sure i know that like if you don't of of exception take it crashed that would figure out like if you don't know some kind of crashes you don't use on	3630.59	3637.55	EN2001e.B.spurt.838 So that they use in the simpler way to just tell which one sound card machines are just to use some conventions is there	1667.69	1673.5	EN2001e.B.spurt.330
A: another as i get from	860.6	862.07	EN2001a.B.spurt.41 Um	862.86	863.51	EN2001a.B.spurt.42 it's uh a hot spots and so on So like would also	863.51	866.78	EN2001a.B.spurt.43 Beyond the front so i think	867.33	869.6	EN2001a.B.spurt.44
B: Basically the the form of the word is important that you can't just replace the work that arbitrary string	2305.47	2309.77	EN2001b.B.spurt.816 uh pots uh an x. m. l. paso way you can get the start times	2971.33	2974.61	EN2001b.C.spurt.1036 How much easier would it be if we truly in this to this so	2922.21	2925.08	EN2001b.B.spurt.1024 The annotation about what what what it used most similar to So be to the segmentation information	293.7	299.4	EN2001b.B.spurt.116
C: and what about the similarity measures for segments do we um	898.32	903.04	EN2001d.A.spurt.315 so in my case it would say some name for this segment And then you just click on it and then like the whole thing which you can	1084.59	1091.01	EN2001d.B.spurt.371 Best utterances for each segment	1441.44	1443.22	EN2001d.B.spurt.530 Like how to summarise the work should always compress the segment to a constant links to buy a constant factor of time or	458.85	465.97	EN2001d.B.spurt.163
D: Sort of way to to different factors that they like it it's for something very similar somebody would try to solve a very similar problem with all set two factors of the want to wait in together	677.24	685.41	EN2001e.B.spurt.135 Sort of in every or other when this one's of the developing a big infrastructure so maybe it's just doing it randomly at the moment no but we have some summary working in as good places to start from	825.89	836.03	EN2001e.B.spurt.169 I think it'll run on on that that's machine If we doing it	3544.09	3547.39	EN2001e.B.spurt.818 To make it not crash if it does have a sound card	3585.46	3587.64	EN2001e.B.spurt.826
A: I think	870.06	870.64	EN2001a.B.spurt.45 Yes	1073.3	1073.75	EN2001a.B.spurt.46 Yes	1131.12	1131.58	EN2001a.B.spurt.47 Yes	1175.41	1175.91	EN2001a.B.spurt.48
B: A directory one two and three And this represents the category everything that's in there is in category one	1604.05	1611.19	EN2001b.C.spurt.575 So we're categories are all those segments of the same topic First meeting	2145.07	2150.53	EN2001b.A.spurt.770 But like for not like you're segmentation is just splitting i meeting up into different blocks	2100.12	2105.28	EN2001b.B.spurt.752 But that's a relatively good measure of whether that's a very specific word in which case they use you were to tell you quite a lot Or a very general were to choose he doesn't tell you quite a lot	1727.03	1734.85	EN2001b.B.spurt.620
C: Each dialogue act um meeting	2151.88	2154.13	EN2001d.A.spurt.790 Um where you can select the final	2517.76	2520.28	EN2001d.B.spurt.914 Today to manager	3010.22	3011.5	EN2001d.D.spurt.1098 And he would have to search button and the similarity thing but mm	1188.55	1192.1	EN2001d.B.spurt.426
D: But until monday it's gonna be really bad like it could be help people if they have problems with getting getting what we have running now but	247.1	253.15	EN2001e.B.spurt.55 It actually gives you never if you put a twenty because there's some things in there which are shorter than twenty And if you select those then is having and	889.75	896.13	EN2001e.B.spurt.180 It's it's screens and stuff i think last time	103.2	105.6	EN2001e.B.spurt.24 I thought coming is a shock to me now because i was sort of in this mindset like i first you oh that's a lot of time between the presentation and the report and then any oh now the presentation is shifted that	3344.77	3354.15	EN2001e.B.spurt.774
A: So just the different baseline not a close	1180.87	1183.72	EN2001a.B.spurt.49 For example it loads of the utterances and so on but it doesn't low to um	1184.38	1189.09	EN2001a.B.spurt.50 be just "'cause" i like its and	1189.09	1191.35	EN2001a.B.spurt.51 Right and not be	1193.01	1194.29	EN2001a.B.spurt.52
B: So that would show you how much relative to how you sort of how is performing generally in that meeting relative to that How he's in a specific segment	3201.66	3209.9	EN2001b.B.spurt.1117 And the information or i mean we are going to create a file that looks more like um the words right	739.49	745.45	EN2001b.A.spurt.276 So provided that you could you words in the right order do you think it is an easy task we are digits of relatively feasible task for you to	2983.61	2989.54	EN2001b.B.spurt.1040 Well understand and send what the segments fine that's about	748.47	751.01	EN2001b.B.spurt.278
C: If we move everything's the right little bit	1201.64	1203.62	EN2001d.D.spurt.432 A real Sort of meaning just put like maxim million	3149.16	3153.08	EN2001d.D.spurt.1140 Yeah that's a wait for come on for an external Like for like so no call	721.12	725.23	EN2001d.B.spurt.258 You know what happened to me today like to have got about the weather i'm not sure he had a problem before finding that java media The java x. media stuff on all the channels for that	1975.1	1984.37	EN2001d.B.spurt.730
D: At the same day you for every utterance that that's exactly right every utterance that is for	2051.17	2056.09	EN2001e.A.spurt.441 Yes probably because You are much if you have to merge with the display at what it is basically a picking up here	1870.69	1876.32	EN2001e.B.spurt.390 Something for just for putting them together in a relatively simple way but still a way that we can sort after five	696.17	701.2	EN2001e.B.spurt.138 Yes i guess if you put s. s. a. g. n. s. t. v. you know kingdom come on top right after with this is a she said that we come on this as a speech again	1387.86	1395.21	EN2001e.B.spurt.270
A: And was that as well yeah	1195.5	1197.08	EN2001a.B.spurt.53 Not the summaries	1197.73	1198.68	EN2001a.B.spurt.54 And you know it's those and amount	1200.06	1201.75	EN2001a.B.spurt.55 You mean that you um	1255.0	1257.19	EN2001a.B.spurt.56
B: In the existing segments fine	1048.96	1050.38	EN2001b.B.spurt.375 A trends whatever you have it or not applied with the same value all the ones that are within that uh trends that sort of a combination of	2704.2	2710.21	EN2001b.B.spurt.938 Like playing around sort of figuring out what's the best way of combining them by playing around looking at the results	2843.6	2848.6	EN2001b.B.spurt.988 So i don't know how parts of the the prototype if we want to show "'em" something on monday	3285.96	3290.83	EN2001b.C.spurt.1155
C: No just have two of them not sink top because it's just a evaluating the data	2839.46	2843.71	EN2001d.D.spurt.1034 Yeah we will have that section it's gonna happen today and we will have problems segments as well	1534.84	1539.3	EN2001d.B.spurt.562 There or something read importance with this year and there's read word important for the one	303.04	307.63	EN2001d.B.spurt.102 Now tony it wouldn't need three internal colours "'cause" "'cause" only once in the clock call it and the others are all absolute	2885.27	2891.91	EN2001d.D.spurt.1051
D: No but i guess i mean If you just if you trust and they see summary for the audio just putting all these things in tucson and then having a britain summary	1681.95	1691.22	EN2001e.B.spurt.336 Yeah you can set the windows start utterance and window and uh trends	3796.63	3800.32	EN2001e.B.spurt.858 A lot of information in the display in the in the way that is when the mouse is over it But i haven't figured out how it works so that's something that probably	3159.18	3165.79	EN2001e.B.spurt.742 In the most Summarise mode just never put them in	524.72	527.7	EN2001e.B.spurt.112
A: basically split at the big thing into um different	1257.19	1260.74	EN2001a.B.spurt.57 Summaries For example it that you have uh a very	1261.51	1264.65	EN2001a.B.spurt.58 Um	1265.17	1265.6	EN2001a.B.spurt.59 Top level	1266.32	1267.02	EN2001a.B.spurt.60
B: I guess as soon as we have a framework in the in the top of the prototype for like sort of each of us	3372.86	3377.23	EN2001b.B.spurt.1181 Have the prototype	3389.69	3390.58	EN2001b.B.spurt.1184 Split one of the uh segment into two segments but	2778.38	2781.3	EN2001b.A.spurt.967 If we have here a link to the segment i like an i. d. for that second but it just create another five which	962.19	967.27	EN2001b.B.spurt.349
C: So you at the moment you have colours for show up on everything that's about that is displayed or How do you	3231.44	3236.94	EN2001d.C.spurt.1168 Uh black i would just i would find logical reasons for why you can just say you keep	2231.32	2236.39	EN2001d.B.spurt.811 So you are we just start everything off the summaries been great	715.83	719.16	EN2001d.D.spurt.256 So this is the component based evaluation need to uh yes and no	1713.34	1717.03	EN2001d.D.spurt.615
D: Utterances that but annotated this agreements	1991.43	1994.18	EN2001e.A.spurt.419 I'm not i'm not sure but i'm not having crashes at the moment so	1.1	4.81	EN2001e.B.spurt.1 I'd call it fixed and the last whatever one hour something that so at the moment that program sort of in between Working on working "'cause" we've got lots of changes try what they are was	140.6	150.35	EN2001e.B.spurt.33 Yeah i mean if you if you if you present be component so what do it's based on then do we need more than twenty minutes to do is and	3398.77	3406.72	EN2001e.A.spurt.788
A: Um summary and	1267.66	1268.97	EN2001a.B.spurt.61 As separate five	1269.86	1271.18	EN2001a.B.spurt.62 For for each level	1271.59	1272.97	EN2001a.B.spurt.63 Uh-huh	1302.54	1302.88	EN2001a.B.spurt.64
B: You do get time based at the moment	1230.95	1232.78	EN2001b.B.spurt.439 Well at the moment would you would like to to solve this problem is you would sort of like write some postscript or something that gets this time bally out of here and	2962.09	2969.16	EN2001b.B.spurt.1034 But going from from uh work business wouldn't be straight and go back and talk like for each utterance	415.21	420.14	EN2001b.B.spurt.157 use an idea something for it so it would be difficult to write it back to the right position	1318.98	1324.77	EN2001b.C.spurt.466
C: Um from yeah on that on that level of not call it reading and the topic segments yeah	1164.19	1168.82	EN2001d.D.spurt.417 Kind of way "'cause" we can just treat all	848.65	851.08	EN2001d.D.spurt.296 well we have to move and then the graphical display that	1529.85	1532.76	EN2001d.A.spurt.560 And if i'm pretty sure that they can always find something sure improve their so i mean if you need me to work on something yeah it's um	1652.22	1660.3	EN2001d.A.spurt.592
D: Writing the report won't be so bad how long as it expected to be	1002.19	1005.23	EN2001e.B.spurt.210 Thing is that at the moment it's just a really bad for me	237.49	240.38	EN2001e.B.spurt.53 Yeah but the performance is really bad at the moment and that and uh	3441.99	3445.36	EN2001e.B.spurt.797 People's questions announces and if you put them on the screen where	169.84	172.87	EN2001e.B.spurt.38
A: Yes	1604.26	1604.71	EN2001a.B.spurt.65 And i know it's four	1627.97	1629.33	EN2001a.B.spurt.66 No you're right yeah	1632.57	1633.59	EN2001a.B.spurt.67 That's for	1634.12	1634.94	EN2001a.B.spurt.68
B: But i mean i didn't to have a look at the data that bad	3045.49	3048.18	EN2001b.A.spurt.1058 And stuff should maybe be structured in a similar way	205.79	208.13	EN2001b.B.spurt.80 They annotation for information density	202.67	205.38	EN2001b.B.spurt.79 The second at the moment split up oh	1116.35	1118.13	EN2001b.B.spurt.402
C: Alternatively we'll we'll have like the whole thing running already when we do the presentation and we just a range of manually nice	1221.63	1229.19	EN2001d.B.spurt.439 So would it be easy slash just a difficult session possible like at the moment if you skip to our	2017.17	2022.55	EN2001d.B.spurt.747 On the actual yeah you can change it for In the summary when the summary gets cold in program energy in the	264.85	271.13	EN2001d.D.spurt.84 And connect up to a summarise isn't that different than summaries	3138.92	3142.2	EN2001d.D.spurt.1136
D: Yeah i mean that was that are sort of any racial condom than the nice fancy drawings that you kate seen them in that was part of it that sort of within a segment you had to stop segment then each of them have different words and	2876.72	2886.14	EN2001e.B.spurt.689 I think Proportion like a wind um i'm always getting myself confused about this but i think sort of	3895.6	3900.51	EN2001e.B.spurt.875 When it's moving on to mean yes it is because what the space program then if you shouldn't be but i think that at a given time constraints from the easy instead of	1876.74	1882.88	EN2001e.B.spurt.391 "'cause" the thing is we can make this at the moment they were it's working because it has a sound card	1633.8	1638.15	EN2001e.B.spurt.321
A: Yeah	1674.47	1675.07	EN2001a.B.spurt.69 Yeah i i think we would just Take these segments that are already	1693.79	1697.76	EN2001a.B.spurt.70 Yeah right	1698.54	1698.89	EN2001a.B.spurt.71 Yeah there's um this segments right	1699.98	1702.07	EN2001a.B.spurt.72
B: So where do you wait you have them from at the moment to split up	1610.19	1613.14	EN2001b.B.spurt.577 Calculating The uh information importance of words	233.42	237.52	EN2001b.C.spurt.93 It's a bit frustrating at the moment as much as that is so like	3343.96	3346.7	EN2001b.B.spurt.1171 It's a bit far into the meeting and and to the project	3358.15	3361.05	EN2001b.B.spurt.1174
C: But that's enough that "'cause" people bit less control over	512.92	515.79	EN2001d.B.spurt.178 And then make a selection space on a segment that what we not quite sure is what's the best way for	451.65	457.74	EN2001d.B.spurt.162 i mean on the final version that's true yeah	2928.01	2930.1	EN2001d.D.spurt.1068 What is it a defeat in the data and you can control any	2214.92	2218.15	EN2001d.D.spurt.808
D: The times thinking of between the relative time it in a sort of in uh	13.37	17.14	EN2001e.B.spurt.4 So that kept us like basically from doing anything else product or for quite some time the last us because we were um hum can understood there are	132.24	140.07	EN2001e.B.spurt.32 So we we had a we had a long problem about not finding out why	7.92	12.58	EN2001e.B.spurt.3 I sure i've got myself like i didn't find it said it it must have to do it a bit of former but then um so if that's so the the good thing about that would be that if you simply say that whatever	1512.41	1520.43	EN2001e.B.spurt.295
A: And you know weeks met segments	1702.7	1704.45	EN2001a.B.spurt.73 That and	1711.24	1711.91	EN2001a.B.spurt.74 Yeah that's um	1748.17	1749.25	EN2001a.B.spurt.75 Um	1773.29	1773.86	EN2001a.B.spurt.77
B: Segment can have or one um of those but strings that are presented in one ninety that's ever	645.33	651.17	EN2001b.A.spurt.255 Good way to me if there's a category information from	1588.28	1590.95	EN2001b.B.spurt.563 occurrences of the with the in each ones so uh this what will be not very informative for course the categories	2206.25	2212.27	EN2001b.C.spurt.793 What are what he's saying about the way i think that's in the lazy loading up like everything i mean that it's not gonna make a note	1086.68	1092.7	EN2001b.B.spurt.389
C: huh where i guess that's just take a look at the foot rope colour cube or whatever it is kim colour cuban	2490.32	2494.74	EN2001d.B.spurt.908 A segment where something starts	1048.09	1050.18	EN2001d.B.spurt.359 Display a bit more information	797.0	798.89	EN2001d.D.spurt.280 It's treating a whole serious is one thing so like ridding one file for the whole serious that kids get rid of the ideas from top to bottom and	2023.13	2029.95	EN2001d.B.spurt.748
D: Freely accessible from you can you show we were because I'm actually not going to happen power at the moment so Don't have to go down	3256.9	3262.83	EN2001e.B.spurt.758 Basically because that's so let the this agreement	2200.78	2203.73	EN2001e.A.spurt.505 So for each utterance you have one A green one disagreement score	2298.68	2302.61	EN2001e.B.spurt.533 For the long utterances i just it's um	2058.02	2061.4	EN2001e.A.spurt.443
A: And for	1774.73	1775.19	EN2001a.B.spurt.78 Um	1775.81	1776.17	EN2001a.B.spurt.79 Segments as far as uh when when you look at the data or what is displayed in one line	1776.54	1781.28	EN2001a.B.spurt.80 What when when you look at it can be	1783.78	1785.87	EN2001a.B.spurt.81
B: Like running it with different Different factor loading sand saying okay	2611.92	2616.39	EN2001b.B.spurt.903 So for example uh it every time and lots of the segment things	1098.77	1102.02	EN2001b.A.spurt.394 Some way that we can at at Chip to a certain time segment	2278.79	2282.76	EN2001b.B.spurt.809 That would be information that's the acquaintance to make any sense if you split them up because i mean the whole i thought the whole thing is if you look at the frequency of a word	1421.39	1428.13	EN2001b.B.spurt.501
C: Maybe top a phone or how feel that and	2818.83	2821.7	EN2001d.D.spurt.1027 The highlight of the dialogue acts	192.97	194.26	EN2001d.B.spurt.51 So what about a general layout like this that we have few the dialogue acts and they have the player	1183.06	1187.63	EN2001d.B.spurt.425 Okay the other one is just a static dialogue act sports	2912.78	2915.28	EN2001d.B.spurt.1060
D: Perhaps might of stuff agreement i kept my list of agreement summer	1805.73	1810.89	EN2001e.A.spurt.370 No an agreement and the agreement and then some	2251.47	2254.43	EN2001e.A.spurt.523 So if if for every yep you'd be sure that it's an agreement and that wouldn't be a problem So you saying that you not sure if every yep that's an agreement or	2467.35	2474.37	EN2001e.B.spurt.590 C. r. ninety annotated agreements or yeah it agreement	2561.39	2565.81	EN2001e.A.spurt.612
A: Yeah i think so as a	1789.83	1791.25	EN2001a.B.spurt.82 Um	1792.91	1793.59	EN2001a.B.spurt.83 fax um i i compare that well what i did for their pulse and racial extraction	1793.59	1799.64	EN2001a.B.spurt.84 Um	1800.26	1800.72	EN2001a.B.spurt.85
B: Which is referencing to be segments here And another attribute which is that the value	1002.23	1006.77	EN2001b.B.spurt.364 They have that utterances displayed in now interface	1149.29	1152.91	EN2001b.C.spurt.414 Um dialogue acts and attach it on it	651.73	653.93	EN2001b.A.spurt.256 So if you slice that but i'm you probably be a which is like Attach like just some	1241.65	1246.96	EN2001b.B.spurt.444
C: No but i see this to convict they have like i see each see each group is completely separate	2245.13	2250.41	EN2001d.B.spurt.813 important matter	366.84	367.72	EN2001d.B.spurt.128 It shouldn't be part of the importance matter if there's no zero	2383.4	2386.61	EN2001d.B.spurt.864 Of the music	189.22	190.05	EN2001d.B.spurt.49
D: it's it's just an informal effectively yeah	1228.42	1230.27	EN2001e.B.spurt.245 Well at the moment our best guess is that it was some stupid channel one thing about if you	22.75	26.95	EN2001e.B.spurt.6 And like putting them one over the power of something on the other one minus one	709.08	712.43	EN2001e.B.spurt.144 Yeah but The the thing is it it isn't simply an act of a setting a string default to to to seems to be something where to to bolt check that you have to create and give it all sorts of different properties and stuff or	3186.59	3198.36	EN2001e.B.spurt.747
A: And basically it's uh words that i i did in a sequence all about power source but sometimes	1801.03	1807.46	EN2001a.B.spurt.86 Um however uh there are um	1807.8	1809.71	EN2001a.B.spurt.87 shop pulses in it and uh indicated by square brackets possible	1809.71	1813.66	EN2001a.B.spurt.88 So i mean the	1814.7	1815.5	EN2001a.B.spurt.89
B: Maybe if you attach a number to each where it and say that it should commit the last part	2353.77	2359.84	EN2001b.C.spurt.836 And i just put one in each category	1637.82	1640.75	EN2001b.C.spurt.593 It's called segment either do we know which fly this is putting from	663.29	666.4	EN2001b.B.spurt.259 Yeah that's fine	259.71	260.41	EN2001b.C.spurt.105
C: Hmmm is anyone have a good idea like at the moment to play around with it what's a good way of	2405.19	2410.32	EN2001d.B.spurt.874 Clearly just a three summarises and then they all seem to put one o'clock	2906.8	2910.71	EN2001d.B.spurt.1058 I have to display code ready by then which just the stuff like	3293.78	3296.97	EN2001d.B.spurt.1187 Yeah i have to find i have to find out there	1600.11	1602.53	EN2001d.B.spurt.580
D: But i mean if if the two visitors were permitted to think of that i've read "'em" on to go directly now so	1080.32	1084.61	EN2001e.B.spurt.224 Check how much more work it would be to do it over flak "'cause" then in the end because otherwise you always have to code word some people might be changing the wrong one	3614.89	3621.64	EN2001e.B.spurt.834 I think for me looks quite a bit of like an uh if every sort of every topic segments us	2605.09	2608.99	EN2001e.B.spurt.622 At the moment get that far that if i now click on to the segmented	746.44	750.91	EN2001e.B.spurt.154
A: Um some that uh that	1820.54	1822.02	EN2001a.B.spurt.90 I i think so	1836.06	1837.16	EN2001a.B.spurt.92 Yeah but um	1870.93	1872.06	EN2001a.B.spurt.93 I think	1873.05	1873.99	EN2001a.B.spurt.94
B: In the worst fine	761.66	762.67	EN2001b.B.spurt.281 So would add that to that fine	1022.65	1024.28	EN2001b.B.spurt.368 Yeah i haven't got in like some of my confirmation that we went stays fine i'm not sure if	3326.78	3331.27	EN2001b.B.spurt.1168 What ways of displaying this information out there	3022.27	3024.23	EN2001b.B.spurt.1051
C: Uh the display also get information about like the relative to me at a time so that would be convenient if it just if there's just one of that "'cause" otherwise it's getting nasty	2847.45	2854.64	EN2001d.B.spurt.1038 To graphical display We don't use we did have to pick which one the same o'clock today	2782.79	2787.47	EN2001d.D.spurt.1015 so you're automatically producing the right for much with this	2001.38	2004.12	EN2001d.B.spurt.738 Yeah so if we email out a script on how to like	2714.78	2718.5	EN2001d.B.spurt.991
D: I think like at the moment If you click on a second or automatically said start talking going uh stuff so we have to comment out stuff	1729.24	1735.04	EN2001e.B.spurt.352 Yeah but that only works at that at the moment isn't done for our system that's just an because then the time changes	3753.57	3758.8	EN2001e.B.spurt.849 So because we basically would be good to have two different wants to play around with one for controlling the length of the summary	1205.71	1212.44	EN2001e.B.spurt.239 Didn't somebody say that actually like a lot of agreements have Have extra words we should should just disagreement like	2229.29	2235.91	EN2001e.B.spurt.518
A: an advocate at trends can have several	1876.95	1878.91	EN2001a.B.spurt.96 Types	1880.1	1880.67	EN2001a.B.spurt.97 For example for the dialogue acts and so on	1881.92	1883.82	EN2001a.B.spurt.98 Okay	1886.57	1887.18	EN2001a.B.spurt.99
B: Several segments which category	1927.26	1929.04	EN2001b.B.spurt.686 The prices of our work tells you but which topic it is what which category like i'm not been i'm not lumping together a separate Topic segments to get a crisp it just like	2237.12	2245.66	EN2001b.B.spurt.800 What i'm i'm doing one segment similarity in the end yeah i'm doing like finding similar segments	2089.36	2094.07	EN2001b.B.spurt.748 Yeah and then at the moment fill in one of my data and i cried seeing how	3360.81	3364.78	EN2001b.A.spurt.1175
C: But if you wanna reacted been change automatically	3107.98	3110.48	EN2001d.B.spurt.1123 So uh which version of manager what's at the very first one	224.8	228.84	EN2001d.A.spurt.63 And then in the same display where we display the set results from the search	923.24	926.65	EN2001d.B.spurt.323 It did do it separately selection	1368.11	1370.15	EN2001d.D.spurt.502
D: If we do it in that most primitive with just saying as long as it's pay more than one meeting	3040.2	3044.34	EN2001e.B.spurt.720 Put that as a as a type like realistic you look at this from the time we have left to do this and stuff	2734.57	2740.12	EN2001e.B.spurt.658 It it should actually be fine especially in that was "'cause" we just introduce a small our class penny will be one of the only gonna present this one's	1585.8	1592.11	EN2001e.B.spurt.307 How much time do we have one of the presentation	3384.1	3386.65	EN2001e.A.spurt.783
A: yeah that would be for	1887.18	1888.43	EN2001a.B.spurt.100 Yeah	1891.11	1891.48	EN2001a.B.spurt.101 Should be yeah	1892.41	1893.0	EN2001a.B.spurt.102 Mm	2427.67	2427.74	EN2001a.B.spurt.103
B: And then we would create a file of that type which	1030.22	1032.89	EN2001b.B.spurt.370 Um create a fan of the of the try and that would be no	1191.64	1195.38	EN2001b.A.spurt.425 And then if she's in in matlab or in something just create	2548.82	2551.37	EN2001b.B.spurt.886 Off then i'd data system now so that maybe soon as i understood that we find ways of doing that in within the night frame broke already so that we don't manually have to parse	2944.33	2954.78	EN2001b.B.spurt.1031
C: A fraction of a second to display would probably too much to updated completely free paint the whole thing every second so	1554.53	1560.61	EN2001d.B.spurt.568 And this is summarised based on just where said at the moment from	132.21	136.35	EN2001d.B.spurt.35 And they wear what am i looking for looking for in data manager where am i looking Was it is it what it is it the the file names ours is here	236.08	243.43	EN2001d.B.spurt.71 Yeah that's well it's not reading that in yeah but that will be But the data manager as well	2563.52	2568.52	EN2001d.D.spurt.931
D: It's a bit check out what they would be like a rubber case is maybe actually if it if there's one word which is very typically made for b. somewhere like uh	2767.35	2773.69	EN2001e.B.spurt.662 Deviation	2373.79	2374.57	EN2001e.A.spurt.556 As zero deviation is only slide key Hi uh	2386.13	2390.11	EN2001e.A.spurt.563 The woodlike put the ones that have no words and then not have really low information then to do something	451.16	455.61	EN2001e.B.spurt.102
A: Yes but that's	2710.76	2712.2	EN2001a.B.spurt.104 That's that's the end so	2759.48	2760.51	EN2001a.B.spurt.106 That's at the end i think	2761.39	2762.65	EN2001a.B.spurt.107 Yeah	2766.95	2767.56	EN2001a.B.spurt.109
B: So this is the idea of a specific segment right	943.01	945.26	EN2001b.B.spurt.345 How much this word tells you about how likely that would be a current of that word makes it that's that's a specific segment	2246.3	2251.91	EN2001b.B.spurt.801 Yeah i mean my not only more But they have the same start and end point sometimes there are two segments and one with the gap in between that And they have	2749.37	2759.04	EN2001b.A.spurt.956 "'kay" kennedy average at your then that's it	3115.35	3117.87	EN2001b.A.spurt.1084
C: But it just doesn't make sense and the logic why sort of like and here it's the meeting about this thing and then it's that thing and and things like first	2135.52	2142.83	EN2001d.B.spurt.784 It looks like it looks like green i think it looks like basically less than than the the their stuff but actually they strip the whole underlying different structure now and	66.73	74.78	EN2001d.B.spurt.14 Yeah so in your case like it would basically would probably say the uh trends here at least some part of it	1076.95	1082.42	EN2001d.B.spurt.368 What will basic think We'll get something to print out the location so we'll range of the noise what do we	1215.77	1221.8	EN2001d.D.spurt.438
D: "'kay" it seems that the moment a lot of the stuff that has a dinosaur for the moment they are they can you do that so that's not idea	1244.25	1249.22	EN2001e.B.spurt.248 So it's it's keeping stuff now i don't think the summary at the moment is what we wanted to be seeing that would say go with them and exactly exactly right sure	785.13	792.81	EN2001e.B.spurt.163 And there's like a good justify the reason and why we should do in a certain way and how we can then with the simple parameter a chance to how much one way is how much the other ways	685.92	694.15	EN2001e.B.spurt.136 The speech tools	1281.5	1282.42	EN2001e.B.spurt.252
A: maybe	2767.56	2767.93	EN2001a.B.spurt.110 Uh	2776.55	2777.14	EN2001a.B.spurt.112 I think it wouldn't us a progress i mean it would be	2779.03	2782.6	EN2001a.B.spurt.113 huh	2785.5	2785.85	EN2001a.B.spurt.115
B: Yes euros relative to the average for the speaker or	3150.45	3153.08	EN2001b.B.spurt.1096 the average	3175.13	3175.95	EN2001b.A.spurt.1106 Right so the average	3178.55	3179.87	EN2001b.B.spurt.1109 No no that's just the average know that	3194.79	3196.95	EN2001b.A.spurt.1114
C: We're gonna call your display	243.05	244.56	EN2001d.D.spurt.74 They they can see it summarise by their data and the other one is the second one	3039.32	3044.0	EN2001d.B.spurt.1106 It's always like a red uh so you should always whatever it is it a half the ritual	481.2	484.83	EN2001d.B.spurt.167 It doesn't really matter that they sync up the product evaluation	2917.02	2920.05	EN2001d.D.spurt.1062
D: But it's probably not and uh and not a simple thing mm	1321.0	1324.44	EN2001e.B.spurt.261 Yeah it's it's it's a good a very simple for it but if you just whatever there	1493.39	1496.8	EN2001e.B.spurt.291 That's probably fairly simple to to actually	3037.19	3039.74	EN2001e.B.spurt.719 And then just sort of "'cause" that's the end house gonna be evaluated you know in the end of this is gonna i mean we're gonna present it and say yeah so this is our teachers disagreements and then we see what what looks good and what looks	2594.04	2604.6	EN2001e.B.spurt.621
A: Coulda	2797.08	2797.48	EN2001a.B.spurt.117 I	2802.33	2805.19	EN2001a.B.spurt.118 I it's just a test the system i think	2810.95	2812.98	EN2001a.B.spurt.119 Mm they have to read numbers	2821.03	2823.11	EN2001a.B.spurt.120
B: Oh there was that's that's to average pace and okay	3195.83	3197.94	EN2001b.B.spurt.1115 And the segments that it's really a better basic that have	1126.44	1129.74	EN2001b.A.spurt.405 And for you that would be quite easy to protect to those segments	3218.32	3221.14	EN2001b.B.spurt.1123 Yeah well i was just like i think that probably the entrance evaluate the moment for a word is Closer to what we're it moment looking for	1681.63	1688.45	EN2001b.B.spurt.606
C: This couple from it it's loading your data not sure if that's it for we look like where uh state uh from	118.4	123.38	EN2001d.B.spurt.30 Do we have everything for the same meeting at the moment like this and uh you you all work on the same meeting	596.92	602.05	EN2001d.B.spurt.212 So it where we're gonna put a search results	1196.14	1198.24	EN2001d.D.spurt.428 If we read moment abandoning abandoning the concept of displaying the whole series of meetings	805.56	812.35	EN2001d.B.spurt.283
D: You could be feel a keeper we have to that extent that last-minute can work with a value but if you're unlucky It might be quicker just write a very something component which is just as just a bar	1183.77	1193.48	EN2001e.B.spurt.236 Would that not happen at some some some chomping and wood that's not happen that summarisation anyway even if they're in	445.35	450.5	EN2001e.B.spurt.101 So that you can do that as machine Independent of	1346.76	1349.37	EN2001e.B.spurt.264 Is any dice machines and the spinning	3254.18	3255.84	EN2001e.B.spurt.757
A: Yeah i didn't have a look at that so	2834.37	2835.89	EN2001a.B.spurt.121 They	2859.9	2860.21	EN2001a.B.spurt.122 Uh-huh	3154.32	3154.63	EN2001a.B.spurt.123 Uh	3334.39	3334.91	EN2001a.B.spurt.124
B: You you could always find out how many words down an utterance could you	2657.21	2661.78	EN2001b.C.spurt.922 Might be difficult to find that out	2589.82	2591.76	EN2001b.C.spurt.896 In mind meeting and have one hundred sixty another meeting that's really	3060.51	3064.29	EN2001b.A.spurt.1063 Yeah i should but actually in a segments uh and not always the same as the segments because and uh segments uh	1257.64	1265.92	EN2001b.A.spurt.449
C: A series of meetings this one Single	2194.59	2197.68	EN2001d.B.spurt.803 Did you move it was the ten seconds what that stuff like that	702.45	705.37	EN2001d.B.spurt.250 Whatever just a are trying to moving at the bottom from our something And then i can just like repaint a small area or something	1577.7	1583.42	EN2001d.B.spurt.572 Presenting some you know all this and then uh segments and	945.73	949.17	EN2001d.A.spurt.330
D: It's a single i don't have a screen he an artist snoop but that's okay	46.67	50.23	EN2001e.B.spurt.12 Yeah perhaps but because it's wide screen or something yeah	1945.72	1948.26	EN2001e.A.spurt.401 I mean them the best ones are definitely those on the first screen yeah	2580.77	2585.24	EN2001e.A.spurt.617 But if you just present the functionality of the thing if you not I don't think this presentation is about the internal workings so	3408.66	3414.83	EN2001e.B.spurt.790
A: "'kay" an eight	3338.25	3339.32	EN2001a.B.spurt.125 Just um	3339.9	3340.84	EN2001a.B.spurt.126 When it so who is	3341.52	3342.94	EN2001a.B.spurt.127 And then doing	3343.45	3344.72	EN2001a.B.spurt.128
B: You mean by matching strings or	2957.78	2960.06	EN2001b.C.spurt.1033 For example the time problem and then okay cool temperament set them to temperaments	559.07	564.52	EN2001b.A.spurt.220 The time	604.03	604.78	EN2001b.A.spurt.238 So this is where it's like Time stops	829.08	831.92	EN2001b.B.spurt.307
C: A lot of work will be done in the last minute In the specific yes that's not a new statement general but	1823.71	1829.17	EN2001d.B.spurt.673 Or to be honest like it's much quicker for me to get stuff done A minute make more sense for us to divide up spend a couple about dividing up tasks	3268.66	3277.19	EN2001d.D.spurt.1181 You click on it and	1092.45	1093.26	EN2001d.B.spurt.375 Something that this place the utterance with the with the word was like This place in a high that that form where it was found	1452.32	1458.05	EN2001d.B.spurt.534
D: Uh we can call stuff that	702.28	703.73	EN2001e.B.spurt.140 We wouldn't call it pressure to do with sort of like	2170.73	2172.95	EN2001e.B.spurt.488 So the third call was that trends for a look that's right	2521.34	2523.72	EN2001e.B.spurt.600 Are we going backwards you know it's only crashed and hangs	2868.01	2871.1	EN2001e.B.spurt.688
A: Um	3345.22	3345.76	EN2001a.B.spurt.129 The if we can see so on the words because and	3347.29	3350.32	EN2001a.B.spurt.130 I think i will also that um	3351.01	3353.35	EN2001a.B.spurt.131 i could also make use of that um for the agreement disagreement	3353.35	3357.25	EN2001a.B.spurt.132
B: First it's time you point um	849.25	851.53	EN2001b.A.spurt.312 Kind of open them on the same time	917.34	919.11	EN2001b.A.spurt.339 So this is an directly having time reference but you can get to a week it is actually here	1233.53	1238.45	EN2001b.B.spurt.441 Um there will be the same topic Several times	2064.11	2067.45	EN2001b.A.spurt.735
C: but try and uh i'd print the utterances and the i. d. And um	2009.27	2013.23	EN2001d.C.spurt.742 The utterances	2117.37	2118.21	EN2001d.B.spurt.779 All the times more sense would have as an option	2747.11	2749.26	EN2001d.D.spurt.1001 continuous plot the corpus so that second meeting be instance three hundred and something	2084.74	2090.28	EN2001d.A.spurt.768
D: For the merging factor if we do it that way with the geometric	1217.13	1220.72	EN2001e.B.spurt.242 I would i would just have to risk is this factor here	2270.78	2273.98	EN2001e.A.spurt.528 Just for us those were uh it's nothing bad and uh state it uh	343.08	347.55	EN2001e.A.spurt.81 No what is this is gonna be so bad like that's gonna be some small of the	3433.29	3437.66	EN2001e.B.spurt.796
A: Because at um	3358.42	3359.54	EN2001a.B.spurt.133 I in my heart and i talked about	3360.52	3362.76	EN2001a.B.spurt.134 Um	3363.34	3363.82	EN2001a.B.spurt.135 Using the um	3364.79	3366.44	EN2001a.B.spurt.136
B: increase speed well that that that applies to several times of course	2488.48	2492.07	EN2001b.A.spurt.870 "'kay" what about the falling model them and this is a very unscientific way of doing it in some sense but what if we if we take time is the standard unit for now and sort of like make a massive	2502.53	2511.36	EN2001b.B.spurt.876 Like for some time period of the overlap in that period and if one's in that period or something	2540.28	2544.81	EN2001b.B.spurt.884 Of things for each for each like sort of time something	2556.63	2559.89	EN2001b.B.spurt.889
C: Yeah oh still okay a continuous on the display	968.77	971.32	EN2001d.D.spurt.338 even without displaying them sort of just continuously	986.31	989.51	EN2001d.B.spurt.342 and that should be fairly easy	1519.17	1520.64	EN2001d.B.spurt.558 They you may not be interested in the same series each time you might want to display all meetings that have this particular	2198.61	2205.4	EN2001d.D.spurt.805
D: Making a very visual display could just	1883.29	1885.08	EN2001e.B.spurt.392 Yeah i was just thing the connectors can probably be done display of um	2661.33	2664.36	EN2001e.B.spurt.643 One displayed so if If the other performances okay then we should really just love the whole	2978.57	2983.05	EN2001e.B.spurt.712 Expect some so i think if the display itself isn't doing anything sake	3602.3	3606.02	EN2001e.B.spurt.830
A: discourse acts first	3366.44	3368.07	EN2001a.B.spurt.137 And um	3368.72	3369.68	EN2001a.B.spurt.138 then and the chance of text I found looking for work package hands and so on	3369.68	3376.22	EN2001a.B.spurt.139 So um	3376.64	3377.82	EN2001a.B.spurt.140
B: Um of time duration should be one word i mean that would be	2631.27	2635.28	EN2001b.A.spurt.910 This touch nine times two method	2783.29	2785.57	EN2001b.A.spurt.969 at that were required at the time where you was actually speaking	3167.86	3171.1	EN2001b.A.spurt.1103 Yeah "'cause" of ask this question fifteen times uh	3222.53	3224.71	EN2001b.B.spurt.1124
C: Yep so we have three colour displays like three or	2924.31	2927.54	EN2001d.B.spurt.1066 No the real problem	637.0	637.95	EN2001d.A.spurt.226 Culminated in place "'cause" the documentation for them as real thick	664.82	668.88	EN2001d.D.spurt.235 The trouble is that he isn't very sensible scale like it comes up to like red it's two or three times	2481.12	2487.46	EN2001d.D.spurt.904
D: That was that section does not that the display they'll because	3731.68	3734.45	EN2001e.B.spurt.846 Wade it doesn't uh the display which part to do Which part two two	3735.37	3738.97	EN2001e.B.spurt.847 Um no but that's not a good idea because that could well be outside the display there it then	3765.25	3769.96	EN2001e.B.spurt.851 Based on the bottom data	1445.63	1447.01	EN2001e.B.spurt.283
A: i would For example you need the	3377.82	3380.24	EN2001a.B.spurt.141 Um most freak	3381.09	3382.09	EN2001a.B.spurt.142 Um	3382.46	3382.99	EN2001a.B.spurt.143 if we couldn't words	3382.99	3384.1	EN2001a.B.spurt.144
B: Find out which way it's not informative for that but	2194.13	2197.09	EN2001b.C.spurt.789 So what if you if you if you get the results from that soft and you go back over it then with that five sort of you right now i really wish	1347.57	1353.33	EN2001b.B.spurt.475 I i and if the uh this taste the same it's no problem at all to it just ride back again but if	1509.63	1515.86	EN2001b.C.spurt.534 So you mean an an attribute	975.62	977.37	EN2001b.C.spurt.353
C: If we could do something like that it displays like a fall you find some are even need	1401.18	1404.96	EN2001d.D.spurt.514 Phrase mention sorry And those might not be the ones we enumerated is one meeting in which case you don't have conflicting i. d.s and things like that	2205.85	2213.6	EN2001d.D.spurt.806 And that runs in sync with what we have in there	173.5	176.3	EN2001d.B.spurt.45 To make sure that the external thing is finished "'cause" in general like that sort of running parallel I think	725.66	730.48	EN2001d.B.spurt.259
D: The data is so on watching this way	1447.42	1449.41	EN2001e.B.spurt.284 Um because it you have to change all sorts of other things we don't have a sound card	1663.39	1666.96	EN2001e.B.spurt.328 It seems to is that the overwhelming majority of that she's don't sound card	1763.14	1767.0	EN2001e.B.spurt.360 and i just had a look at the yeah data	2377.19	2380.15	EN2001e.A.spurt.559
A: So if you kind of all that that it would be	3384.87	3388.3	EN2001a.B.spurt.145 Use or	3389.42	3389.89	EN2001a.B.spurt.146 Yeah at that i needed for might chance then i would	3399.08	3402.34	EN2001a.B.spurt.147 You know	3403.47	3403.85	EN2001a.B.spurt.148
B: Which attributes that bring in	1020.73	1022.08	EN2001b.B.spurt.367 Would that be easiest to just incorporate in your attribute in the in this file	1043.07	1048.57	EN2001b.C.spurt.374 Well we have like whenever to well use value a an value beep was as attributes for	3007.18	3011.88	EN2001b.B.spurt.1047 All the stuff that causes annotation if you have in the right for much	154.96	157.81	EN2001b.B.spurt.67
C: Uh we should try running a thing again see what it does now	1245.26	1248.13	EN2001d.D.spurt.446 Video take that code from the original	1298.34	1300.79	EN2001d.A.spurt.475 Maybe that's the problem maybe they have got um the minus and the code as well and then something in	1357.41	1363.14	EN2001d.C.spurt.499 Yeah i think we run through the underestimated how long it takes this yep true uh	1805.97	1810.33	EN2001d.D.spurt.666
D: So they are you gonna make something primitive that people can load the data in	3562.88	3566.62	EN2001e.B.spurt.822 One minus the power of something uh that sort of and they they've got some graphs about like what they show like wanna go from zero to be one and the other going to do wanna like all the all the landscape changes are the parameter changes how it works that's quite good	713.11	725.08	EN2001e.B.spurt.145 It is running through it and i also you see the indicator in will be are is chomping	780.41	784.59	EN2001e.B.spurt.162 Anyway i'm running out And	1608.91	1610.58	EN2001e.B.spurt.310
A: Yeah but i i would like to look at the frequency of words and my	3406.56	3411.21	EN2001a.B.spurt.149 Um and the regions of text i found out to be Interesting	3412.13	3417.87	EN2001a.B.spurt.150 So i wouldn't need it to a good to have to be re calculated only from a segment	3418.94	3423.98	EN2001a.B.spurt.151 Up for that	3431.33	3432.25	EN2001a.B.spurt.152
B: In some way like it in the end it'll resolve in one annotation	281.8	284.58	EN2001b.B.spurt.113 Annotation What have	381.29	383.32	EN2001b.A.spurt.144 A dialogue act annotations of talent actors that just another indication of text	636.46	640.49	EN2001b.B.spurt.252 No that that annotation of dialogue acts and one um	641.31	644.65	EN2001b.A.spurt.254
C: Well at the moment the main data that it's just	2100.07	2103.73	EN2001d.D.spurt.773 That's very states are on the display but the segments it just made up on right	122.99	127.42	EN2001d.D.spurt.31 Yeah and i mean that's quite true you train going to a lot of all the work today	522.69	526.62	EN2001d.D.spurt.181 All you need today is just one value	1584.42	1586.76	EN2001d.D.spurt.576
D: Find them good enough	1816.37	1818.27	EN2001e.A.spurt.374 That is power same	2010.67	2012.64	EN2001e.A.spurt.427 Power initially where we could	2139.37	2140.97	EN2001e.B.spurt.480 When that things would run on any thing	3482.92	3486.0	EN2001e.B.spurt.805
A: I think it	3433.77	3434.46	EN2001a.B.spurt.153 Would be	3435.73	3436.56	EN2001a.B.spurt.154 That's quite small yeah that's some utterances	3443.29	3445.84	EN2001a.B.spurt.156 Yes yeah	3459.89	3460.85	EN2001a.B.spurt.157
B: It's not a annotated at all	3225.04	3227.26	EN2001b.C.spurt.1127 Not very informative But what's the down in one class of very informative for that class	1831.42	1837.12	EN2001b.C.spurt.648 How would that be the best tie in with the system	872.82	875.54	EN2001b.B.spurt.321 To tie the things together like if you doing it on on the word bases you with those words that in the end	1202.26	1206.38	EN2001b.B.spurt.428
C: Today	1937.72	1938.15	EN2001d.B.spurt.719 You are there ever display would definitely have more information	801.19	803.74	EN2001d.B.spurt.281 And then you'll see the final just plain you realise that it was all fake did we did make you do any of the work	1801.31	1805.67	EN2001d.B.spurt.663 Well you doing feel about that	1853.91	1855.46	EN2001d.D.spurt.687
D: Utterances more or less	160.14	161.45	EN2001e.B.spurt.35 In the brackets that in this window here is the utterances	2039.6	2044.14	EN2001e.A.spurt.439 In principle the flavour longer utterances	2073.12	2076.6	EN2001e.A.spurt.449 And yeah and every and everything up of that threshold i could then at the utterance for it occurs	2178.92	2184.54	EN2001e.B.spurt.494
A: So i would probably just concatenate oh my	3461.34	3464.33	EN2001a.B.spurt.158 Um takes trends and then that same i will	3465.34	3467.84	EN2001a.B.spurt.159 Well no but	3468.45	3468.95	EN2001a.B.spurt.160 Yes	3475.12	3475.6	EN2001a.B.spurt.161
B: Not much more work than just the use of thing and then you can see how they can tie that in the other stuff	2264.49	2268.79	EN2001b.B.spurt.805 Tie a rainbow stuff into	2274.85	2276.4	EN2001b.B.spurt.808 And we just see whatever you whatever you supply as we try to tie in and we shall i was in some way or another	3302.0	3307.44	EN2001b.B.spurt.1158 Another calculated actually	1735.13	1736.73	EN2001b.C.spurt.621
C: We could just make that right to be something completely different	3080.44	3083.62	EN2001d.D.spurt.1117 It might be it might take half an hour and a display in a one	3003.04	3005.8	EN2001d.B.spurt.1095 "'kay" this is the why don't we need a half to three then "'cause" then i can like under three we should i have all the display	3280.21	3285.62	EN2001d.B.spurt.1183 They're not component	1302.08	1303.35	EN2001d.D.spurt.477
D: here they list of utterances that um	2223.35	2225.91	EN2001e.A.spurt.516 Like an average ten ten utterance a part or something	2538.9	2541.81	EN2001e.B.spurt.606 I think some of the bottom line and which might where you end up what it's gotta be like is that we take this thing the highest ranked utterance	2727.01	2734.02	EN2001e.B.spurt.657 Just because it's it's gonna look stupid if we've everything working but just	1271.39	1274.58	EN2001e.B.spurt.251
A: Yes	3823.36	3823.86	EN2001a.B.spurt.162 Yeah	3824.85	3825.08	EN2001a.B.spurt.163 okay	3825.08	3825.54	EN2001a.B.spurt.164 Uh-huh	4192.83	4193.16	EN2001a.B.spurt.165
B: How exactly it it um calculates everything and i think it's not possible to look that up	2216.08	2221.42	EN2001b.C.spurt.795 And for those i calculated um	3171.74	3175.13	EN2001b.A.spurt.1105 And zero measurements and all those way is to get from there at um	1218.87	1223.29	EN2001b.A.spurt.435 Or we could even have a look at a different measures if they	2851.58	2855.17	EN2001b.C.spurt.992
C: Oh it's all part the same component But does that	1306.07	1308.83	EN2001d.D.spurt.479 do you think if we override that component just override whatever the the action to that slide bar is	1311.0	1315.91	EN2001d.B.spurt.482 Sort of a source more component	1484.87	1487.04	EN2001d.B.spurt.547 Can probably add up all the files that up box of minimum effort because i think is a ready made component that becomes a string	1923.12	1928.79	EN2001d.B.spurt.714
D: Mm yes but maybe then expensive for um a been a stupid looking way though	2649.06	2653.34	EN2001e.B.spurt.637 Don't ask you what happened to the promise that you'll get your script for you can use your own stuff because actually that was for freddie but then we saw started	216.84	223.32	EN2001e.B.spurt.50 So i just started up what we have now and then we can talk about what different people have and stuff	259.52	263.89	EN2001e.B.spurt.58 the group direct print just use this creek it really seems to be on the what starting in the directory	1075.16	1079.31	EN2001e.B.spurt.223
A: Yeah right	4246.68	4247.25	EN2001a.B.spurt.166 Um	4256.27	4256.68	EN2001a.B.spurt.167 yes mean	4256.68	4257.21	EN2001a.B.spurt.168 Um what is um	4257.64	4259.42	EN2001a.B.spurt.169
B: You measuring	3148.69	3149.44	EN2001b.B.spurt.1095 Work best with Utterances those segments	391.41	394.16	EN2001b.A.spurt.149 So uh it's it's not very sensible at the moment because i'm waiting for that um topic segments so and just yeah	1641.3	1647.75	EN2001b.C.spurt.594 You have to certain categories	1443.43	1445.3	EN2001b.C.spurt.507
C: I dunno does really make sense to call four oh i don't know anything about taxes	1942.38	1946.47	EN2001d.D.spurt.723 Logical that programmatically rather than doing it	2218.64	2221.47	EN2001d.D.spurt.809 Like each of those components for	2800.04	2802.11	EN2001d.B.spurt.1019 Oh of course there's no reason why we can't make a development version that displays voice	2773.32	2778.41	EN2001d.D.spurt.1013
D: Yeah save performance was a generally works fine	2968.76	2971.23	EN2001e.B.spurt.710 so for them i think realistically since everything in this universe is or works and what our sources stuff so this is two groups that are probably it's gonna be roughly half an hour each	3416.4	3424.99	EN2001e.B.spurt.794 But for motion should be fine	3494.63	3495.78	EN2001e.B.spurt.809 Makes it very easy to always and uh that the	3921.78	3923.55	EN2001e.B.spurt.879
A: the text you are extracting	4259.42	4261.26	EN2001a.B.spurt.170 And looking Like then at the end	4261.94	4264.26	EN2001a.B.spurt.171 Because um	4268.3	4269.31	EN2001a.B.spurt.172 i i think it's actually very similar to what they did for my	4269.31	4273.04	EN2001a.B.spurt.173
B: And you have several document that category	1553.7	1556.56	EN2001b.C.spurt.548 Which words our typical for a certain category	1563.08	1566.86	EN2001b.C.spurt.553 Of values for each category	1896.03	1898.16	EN2001b.C.spurt.675 But in that category would have the same value	1898.62	1901.01	EN2001b.C.spurt.677
C: That's just for one meeting at the moment	2703.7	2705.43	EN2001d.C.spurt.988 So the moment the display still	115.85	117.64	EN2001d.B.spurt.29 Yeah we need to get on that pretty sure uh	535.81	538.45	EN2001d.D.spurt.185 One whole group is one single thing and just work on it	576.81	579.26	EN2001d.B.spurt.205
D: Yeah we somehow was good for can go in different ways every time	123.02	126.52	EN2001e.B.spurt.30 Very different from what we had last time	213.63	215.35	EN2001e.B.spurt.49 Does anyone have a general overview over the whole time issue like	922.14	925.71	EN2001e.B.spurt.185 Yeah i think we should get take the time because i think it would be	985.3	989.04	EN2001e.A.spurt.207
A: Um	4273.45	4273.88	EN2001a.B.spurt.174 speak it um	4273.88	4275.03	EN2001a.B.spurt.175 Uh extraction and i think i would sure	4275.96	4279.14	EN2001a.B.spurt.176 Perhaps have to Change two lines of code to get you	4279.85	4283.26	EN2001a.B.spurt.177
B: You did wouldn't you need several documents for each category	1923.47	1926.68	EN2001b.B.spurt.685 At least it works if there are several categories with each With one document each but it	1936.13	1942.51	EN2001b.C.spurt.691 Everest topic would be its own category	1948.96	1951.17	EN2001b.B.spurt.695 Examples of the same category sort of in in a way	2179.95	2182.78	EN2001b.B.spurt.784
C: Also the crossed out a pretty terrible	1330.35	1332.41	EN2001d.D.spurt.488 "'cause" that be playing it backwards twice as quickly	1340.64	1343.09	EN2001d.D.spurt.493 It doesn't reacted been change also has to be anyway yeah it's when you press play	3113.47	3118.05	EN2001d.D.spurt.1126 Changing one single Method and that	3131.47	3133.64	EN2001d.B.spurt.1133
D: And the time	1000.98	1001.8	EN2001e.A.spurt.209 Have a slight but we can adjust uh you if you if you can figure out a way like how basically uh generally because this at least two points in which we're interested in that	1159.69	1168.53	EN2001e.B.spurt.232 How was the audio thing going is that Before we don't have time to work on that	1232.73	1236.37	EN2001e.B.spurt.247 Seeing that realistically with a given time frame we're not gonna do a may using new things from now on	1798.9	1803.86	EN2001e.B.spurt.368
A: Um	4283.74	4284.32	EN2001a.B.spurt.178 And this millisecond to this maybe second there was this sequence of words	4287.95	4292.45	EN2001a.B.spurt.180 And so on	4294.1	4294.62	EN2001a.B.spurt.181 So	4296.12	4296.53	EN2001a.B.spurt.182
B: but it and i think it should work for just one document because it it compares between the categories and if you just have one document	2183.21	2191.4	EN2001b.C.spurt.786 Category on which are not so if you have just one document in each	2197.5	2201.87	EN2001b.C.spurt.790 Category	2202.27	2202.97	EN2001b.C.spurt.791 So a could you put the whole information we can then	1530.33	1533.0	EN2001b.A.spurt.539
C: If we look the top of my display	75.22	76.65	EN2001d.B.spurt.15 Yeah especially "'cause" i mean that's that's that's the only down like ones Ever done selection change that's right	691.56	697.44	EN2001d.B.spurt.248 words importance five	247.22	248.35	EN2001d.B.spurt.76 Well i i don't know how we're gonna do the fusing of the different have an important issues anyway but if that's done in the program or if that's done	2391.82	2398.91	EN2001d.B.spurt.867
D: That time click off the clock i think that's changeable	1851.92	1855.09	EN2001e.B.spurt.387 And that's just There's a there's some background noise for that work and i think that is because it's like doing so much every time	1861.13	1867.23	EN2001e.B.spurt.389 Make the time we make the clock whatever Sir point five seconds	1885.51	1889.03	EN2001e.B.spurt.393 Times two two	2405.53	2406.48	EN2001e.A.spurt.571
A: That's just changing two lines of code	4297.05	4299.4	EN2001a.B.spurt.183 And then would you feel that so	4300.15	4301.43	EN2001a.B.spurt.184 Um	4307.77	4308.16	EN2001a.B.spurt.185 yeah so far i extracted to um the do it	4308.16	4311.23	EN2001a.B.spurt.186
B: Because we probably couldn't call it segmented much people might have to have different for freedom the truth it	1033.96	1038.84	EN2001b.B.spurt.371 Yeah i have a gut feeling it's not a good idea to split it	1466.9	1469.3	EN2001b.B.spurt.516 Yeah just split it up some how yeah	1613.72	1616.2	EN2001b.C.spurt.579 Split Them up a somehow	1625.58	1628.37	EN2001b.C.spurt.586
C: Do you have the the just the word importance	2444.14	2446.78	EN2001d.C.spurt.886 For all are different from should be oceans to the importance much really um	2588.04	2592.52	EN2001d.A.spurt.943 But they talk doesn't start before well that the audio on the cochran's things on off so	711.69	716.12	EN2001d.B.spurt.253 So you have to stop and started to make any of that	3121.55	3124.25	EN2001d.D.spurt.1130
D: uh because that's like the only time that i was spelled with three a. and stuff i think i think that might be a problem of the whole um	2773.69	2779.76	EN2001e.B.spurt.663 Hi but then probably it's the only time that mm goes back to the top at the end and stuff so	2793.17	2797.37	EN2001e.B.spurt.672 Anyone feel so they have free time has the joke	3127.03	3130.21	EN2001e.B.spurt.735 If anybody looks into that then let me know otherwise outside look into the senate have time again but if anybody	3205.31	3210.39	EN2001e.B.spurt.749
A: Is your asians but uh it's from the words files so i could just	4311.7	4316.05	EN2001a.B.spurt.187 Um	4316.68	4317.16	EN2001a.B.spurt.188 Okay could concatenate um	4318.19	4320.35	EN2001a.B.spurt.189 The words instead of the	4320.84	4322.43	EN2001a.B.spurt.190
B: Oh and when it splits the topic stop it does	2076.0	2078.79	EN2001b.D.spurt.740 Rather than just splitting somewhere	2164.27	2166.37	EN2001b.C.spurt.777 And then not order or And if and only fifty two down to tell you what do we talk about	790.13	795.8	EN2001b.B.spurt.289 Naturally can order for a thing	2638.3	2639.96	EN2001b.A.spurt.913
C: Uh across meetings and separating this um	949.55	951.96	EN2001d.A.spurt.331 Each meeting separately	2605.25	2606.53	EN2001d.A.spurt.952 But do we really want to display them separately because we use that one uh okay fine now files	2433.81	2440.06	EN2001d.A.spurt.880 It's not very much points out the mine is quite nice property the the dialogue that number also it coincides with here i index number	2159.71	2166.96	EN2001d.D.spurt.794
D: It's better to to it And i didn't have the time at that point to get deeper into that so if anybody gets	3224.12	3228.92	EN2001e.B.spurt.752 For time for analysis t. next week "'cause" there's nothing have to do then	3278.72	3282.84	EN2001e.B.spurt.761 Um numbers we assigned to the dialogue acts because	298.8	302.39	EN2001e.A.spurt.66 the dialogue act labels well that's	2089.05	2091.72	EN2001e.A.spurt.457
A: Durations	4323.04	4323.83	EN2001a.B.spurt.191 And the chip	4324.65	4325.23	EN2001a.B.spurt.192 I mean	4326.52	4326.79	EN2001a.B.spurt.193 Should be very	4329.3	4330.28	EN2001a.B.spurt.194
B: You never know how much to talk a little bit	216.26	218.15	EN2001b.D.spurt.83 Probably have to do a bit of	1211.09	1212.2	EN2001b.B.spurt.430 Which would be the same for it The word in each position so that's uh that's doing something a bit different and like	1710.23	1715.96	EN2001b.B.spurt.616 Would be more give a i mean it would be a bit more	1910.57	1913.28	EN2001b.A.spurt.681
C: In the array of dialogue yeah	2167.74	2169.23	EN2001d.D.spurt.795 Okay so we'll produce a worse stuff this which opens up with that dialogue box	2513.17	2517.39	EN2001d.B.spurt.913 "'kay" guess the dialogue	2845.57	2847.08	EN2001d.B.spurt.1037 so i'll need to Do some changes to programme manager to be able to handle	544.33	548.89	EN2001d.D.spurt.190
D: Dialogue acts	2566.26	2567.14	EN2001e.A.spurt.614 List of agreement	1811.68	1812.85	EN2001e.B.spurt.371 Probably agreement	1826.0	1827.83	EN2001e.A.spurt.380 Yeah most probably the words that that Sure in agreement	1966.68	1971.12	EN2001e.A.spurt.413
A: So it would	4331.48	4332.16	EN2001a.B.spurt.195 I can try to do it in sent to you	4334.25	4336.34	EN2001a.B.spurt.196 And you have a budget	4337.27	4338.5	EN2001a.B.spurt.197 Well that makes sense for what you want	4338.95	4341.0	EN2001a.B.spurt.198
B: Yeah in in a sense mean this is a bit like they want like document frequency over got a frequency	2014.43	2019.71	EN2001b.B.spurt.716 And it's it's a bit more sophisticated and that but then Key factor just ends up doing that	2439.44	2443.92	EN2001b.B.spurt.855 That's a bit	2874.1	2874.67	EN2001b.A.spurt.1004 Costs all bad uh-huh	48.11	49.69	EN2001b.B.spurt.24
C: Wait one	828.47	829.56	EN2001d.A.spurt.289 Yeah but it it it should it appears a continuous thing For that	965.43	969.47	EN2001d.B.spurt.337 That takes a manager should be Quite well documented	1144.35	1147.66	EN2001d.D.spurt.408 I think it should everything should be like that continues in chronological order	2299.22	2302.84	EN2001d.D.spurt.836
D: that okay agreement	1996.48	1997.67	EN2001e.A.spurt.422 Annotated s. agreements There and not see or hear	2095.18	2098.68	EN2001e.A.spurt.460 Kind of agreement that people we want to have	2116.23	2118.09	EN2001e.A.spurt.468 No agreements	2130.21	2131.14	EN2001e.A.spurt.475
A: Yeah but i mean it i just let it run over all the files so	4354.56	4358.85	EN2001a.B.spurt.199 Yes	4361.03	4361.46	EN2001a.B.spurt.200 It is so that	4362.2	4362.99	EN2001a.B.spurt.201 I i was according to the um	4365.88	4367.91	EN2001a.B.spurt.202
B: yeah probably yeah maybe it's it's bad have a right it myself because	1668.41	1672.54	EN2001b.C.spurt.603 In that specific whole for working or course of a certain topic versus whole matter "'cause" over the whole	1428.65	1433.83	EN2001b.B.spurt.503 Uh specific topic that boss	1861.36	1862.78	EN2001b.B.spurt.655 For specific	1876.37	1877.02	EN2001b.B.spurt.666
C: You mean this continuous	2952.28	2953.39	EN2001d.B.spurt.1078 I i realise was pointing about screen you don't see so this stuff Summarised based on	145.24	150.29	EN2001d.B.spurt.37 Hi how do you do the summary is it	263.16	265.22	EN2001d.C.spurt.83 Yeah easiest thing is in programme and where it makes a summary With the best way to the	281.0	285.9	EN2001d.D.spurt.92
D: So just like whatever three means agreement on the internet just right	2345.18	2348.22	EN2001e.B.spurt.547 Something agreement and then it's easier can stand for both of us what's going on	2348.75	2352.3	EN2001e.B.spurt.548 If it's really yeah i had a like agreement that would sound different	2417.4	2421.38	EN2001e.A.spurt.575 yeah i i know that not every have some agreement because	2477.2	2480.52	EN2001e.A.spurt.592
A: Yeah terms of	4369.63	4370.33	EN2001a.B.spurt.204 What do you mean they did	4382.18	4383.28	EN2001a.B.spurt.205 Yeah one who	4411.31	4412.08	EN2001a.B.spurt.208 I i i	4415.31	4417.98	EN2001a.B.spurt.209
B: For a specific word per hour	1881.08	1883.17	EN2001b.C.spurt.668 Just whether we're is a very specific word	1974.25	1976.35	EN2001b.B.spurt.704 I'd like to is some hope that probably having Just end so that's not very specific words if you mark them as being more interesting than the words that are only were a general where's the the would guess somewhere	1981.64	1992.13	EN2001b.B.spurt.708 That's something Which has a specific about this	2408.94	2411.91	EN2001b.B.spurt.849
C: How nice summary	301.47	302.63	EN2001d.D.spurt.101 Maybe you being used the summary construct than	311.94	314.69	EN2001d.D.spurt.107 We definitely but um having a different summary	361.78	364.34	EN2001d.B.spurt.126 Of of summarisation what should be the constant	474.66	477.52	EN2001d.B.spurt.165
D: Something in between the three in and five agreements but not more Probably maybe less but not much less and	2614.03	2620.47	EN2001e.B.spurt.630 Every makes the code lot more readable for everybody use	2339.61	2342.2	EN2001e.B.spurt.545 Actually that's what i've kinda like the current code just takes a tenth of	3924.26	3927.54	EN2001e.B.spurt.880 So i'm not really sure what this meeting is about to be honest um	206.09	209.72	EN2001e.B.spurt.47
A: I	4420.03	4420.39	EN2001a.B.spurt.210 I	4437.89	4439.31	EN2001a.B.spurt.212 Yes	4444.86	4445.14	EN2001a.B.spurt.213 Um	4445.72	4446.33	EN2001a.B.spurt.214
B: But i i mean that's not uh the information that is in in that Corpus and uh in the segments i i think that's just just the	1058.72	1066.87	EN2001b.A.spurt.380 Score which actually	1708.36	1709.46	EN2001b.B.spurt.615 Score all over the place	1888.81	1890.53	EN2001b.B.spurt.672 Maybe we should look into making that score	1963.11	1965.23	EN2001b.B.spurt.700
C: Yeah although you can get all the options this	1172.85	1175.11	EN2001d.D.spurt.421 The context what the options before you could sell from your from softer	1474.75	1478.63	EN2001d.D.spurt.543 There's more like an option	1947.78	1948.97	EN2001d.D.spurt.724 That means you got more flexibility of how you want to group them and one thing you really don't want Is to have a to have Two options say is that could potentially have the same i. d.	2124.61	2133.85	EN2001d.D.spurt.783
D: like thirty three in the in the first meeting	348.78	352.04	EN2001e.A.spurt.83 And then i ran it on the first meeting Getting um	2031.73	2036.49	EN2001e.A.spurt.437 Get us For the first meeting	2226.41	2228.82	EN2001e.A.spurt.517 I think for this meeting um	2553.71	2555.78	EN2001e.A.spurt.607
A: that you you the data us off the phone you have um three identification let us o. b. e. d. u. r. p. b. d. or something and that's always the same group And then after that there's um	4446.33	4458.63	EN2001a.B.spurt.215 a number like oh oh one or two so	4458.63	4461.29	EN2001a.B.spurt.216 Yeah that that's that's Really quite	4470.2	4472.38	EN2001a.B.spurt.217 Easy to just see that's And and	4472.92	4475.36	EN2001a.B.spurt.218
B: Just as a preliminary score that we have	1965.93	1967.76	EN2001b.B.spurt.701 So what would it be higher score of than word that	2025.27	2028.1	EN2001b.A.spurt.719 Uh vocabulary like some of the dictionary tree each word gives an interview score	2227.25	2231.37	EN2001b.B.spurt.797 Yeah i think if we work together on a on an interview based score	2391.02	2394.04	EN2001b.B.spurt.844
C: Well what was the option be	2750.19	2751.43	EN2001d.B.spurt.1002 Or just so you can configure the the location all the files as an option	2751.99	2755.78	EN2001d.D.spurt.1005 Has to be when options window is and uh	2779.16	2782.05	EN2001d.D.spurt.1014 And the summarise it but	3012.08	3013.21	EN2001d.D.spurt.1099
D: Information about two	673.14	674.26	EN2001e.B.spurt.133 But i mean the fact that different ones have the same number in itself is no problem is that	2454.27	2458.65	EN2001e.B.spurt.588 They Correlation between those two facts Interdependence is there some fancy planning language about that	3354.89	3360.95	EN2001e.B.spurt.775 I know that you assigned be dedicate number did you take the one you found in d.	591.31	597.33	EN2001e.A.spurt.117
A: Yes but	4492.1	4493.27	EN2001a.B.spurt.219 I mean	4493.89	4494.35	EN2001a.B.spurt.220 As um	4494.77	4495.63	EN2001a.B.spurt.221 Um	4498.17	4498.74	EN2001a.B.spurt.223
B: That's just that's somewhere to start from	2435.59	2437.39	EN2001b.B.spurt.854 And we know that word starts at the second an end to that second	2535.08	2537.99	EN2001b.B.spurt.882 you know basic	1094.87	1095.99	EN2001b.A.spurt.392 It it's basically they uh it's the senate and trophy for men or And you sort of see you	1738.28	1742.12	EN2001b.B.spurt.623
C: Whatever it's doing And then have that set the length of the summary or something like that	3086.05	3090.46	EN2001d.D.spurt.1119 Let's just loaded with chances that just to see different	216.38	219.3	EN2001d.B.spurt.59 Nato to this i think a fairly straight	1496.67	1498.26	EN2001d.B.spurt.550 Load it	2719.1	2719.78	EN2001d.B.spurt.992
D: I don't know that's fifty percent of the map	1005.57	1007.85	EN2001e.A.spurt.211 One thing that would be convenient for all sorts of things which i haven't found out about it	3131.65	3136.04	EN2001e.B.spurt.738 Yeah i'm not i'm not a hundred percent sure what needs to be changed to make it work with the	3579.61	3583.85	EN2001e.B.spurt.825 so let's wake up for a grim and then for disagreement i did us but	2194.29	2198.35	EN2001e.A.spurt.502
A: step	4498.74	4499.29	EN2001a.B.spurt.224 Probably just um	4503.09	4504.42	EN2001a.B.spurt.226 at the uh	4504.42	4505.54	EN2001a.B.spurt.227 Um finer uh	4505.9	4507.06	EN2001a.B.spurt.228
B: Yeah me is so in our case basically every	1944.99	1947.67	EN2001b.B.spurt.693 Again it's it's very it gives you like i look at the prosodic it's basically something in the end which way to eat l. c. o.	1968.84	1973.81	EN2001b.B.spurt.703 It's it's it's really it's a very simple thing but it it basically just	2404.26	2407.76	EN2001b.B.spurt.848 In a sense it's in a it's it's basically just in two at a high degree	2412.32	2416.2	EN2001b.B.spurt.850
C: The highlight it doesn't change and now he does it So if you just remember the colour that was lost at	1588.1	1594.2	EN2001d.D.spurt.577 Any re draw a line behind it That's that colour and then yeah	1594.68	1598.71	EN2001d.D.spurt.579 In colour because then we could do Just means and and where is probably in the same scale	2423.0	2427.71	EN2001d.B.spurt.876 No no it's uh much colour work	2474.36	2476.01	EN2001d.B.spurt.901
D: But i i that should be okay that should be okay i i'd be a bit too	54.16	57.08	EN2001e.B.spurt.14 It might just be at this point like that sometimes a point loading not usually that long well let's see	72.62	78.25	EN2001e.B.spurt.16 that's just great it's alright just resize it a bit	753.13	755.67	EN2001e.B.spurt.156 So we are gonna be hopefully be a bit	1804.52	1806.12	EN2001e.B.spurt.369
A: And so i'm just put it all together	4509.41	4511.48	EN2001a.B.spurt.230 And then we would have to change um	4512.17	4515.04	EN2001a.B.spurt.231 the information about who on which channel it costs said	4515.04	4519.13	EN2001a.B.spurt.232 And to what they which person it was said and uh just actually started another x. m. l. document	4519.6	4525.26	EN2001a.B.spurt.233
B: So you say that means like you basically say we having an array where each Each cell is is one like this is one word	2664.64	2671.4	EN2001b.B.spurt.927 As soon as i'm halfway through my l. s. a. like basically so that's i have there	3270.44	3274.9	EN2001b.B.spurt.1151 Displayed	453.14	453.84	EN2001b.A.spurt.173 The second is what is displayed in one line	612.21	614.59	EN2001b.A.spurt.241
C: And and then you'll get this time of display	2523.54	2526.08	EN2001d.B.spurt.917 Just one meeting like would would the display for example still be able to just say i want from whatever from the first into the last and and everything in between sort of and	2263.39	2271.39	EN2001d.B.spurt.818 Display that just for that meeting	2274.22	2275.81	EN2001d.B.spurt.820 so it wouldn't be displayed and and the uh graphical display	928.9	933.4	EN2001d.A.spurt.325
D: Hmmm it's a bit smaller but	1934.85	1936.76	EN2001e.A.spurt.398 it's a bit more	2199.37	2200.3	EN2001e.A.spurt.504 Arbitrarily long lists from the british national corpus	2815.16	2818.56	EN2001e.B.spurt.677 And then the way how long um	3381.64	3383.75	EN2001e.A.spurt.782
A: Yeah	4538.16	4538.59	EN2001a.B.spurt.234 it	4538.59	4538.68	EN2001a.B.spurt.235 Then just	4539.6	4540.42	EN2001a.B.spurt.236 Not a printout d.	4540.9	4542.43	EN2001a.B.spurt.237
B: But display word so i think	1104.68	1106.12	EN2001b.A.spurt.396 D. display for any	1130.32	1131.7	EN2001b.A.spurt.406 But they display	1134.55	1135.64	EN2001b.C.spurt.407 displayed	1145.15	1145.77	EN2001b.C.spurt.411
C: Just work wrong so i i have a display at make sure that my display does all the stuff we've talked about and	3327.89	3333.16	EN2001d.B.spurt.1200 But then also we'd have to find more sophisticated with a floating it	2986.68	2989.18	EN2001d.B.spurt.1089 It's not that much to do unless i get some evaluation method	1693.69	1697.91	EN2001d.C.spurt.605 Because if i if i can't evaluate i can't do any better	1705.41	1708.96	EN2001d.C.spurt.609
D: Yes that's quite a bit you have to comment on for that	3588.71	3590.89	EN2001e.B.spurt.827 So as long as In the main	3606.44	3608.41	EN2001e.B.spurt.831 As long as you can don't work for the people wouldn't know	3834.08	3836.15	EN2001e.B.spurt.862 Amazing strides colour combination to see in front of me at the moment	115.05	118.24	EN2001e.B.spurt.29
A: Um	4542.99	4543.4	EN2001a.B.spurt.238 No it's for every single word	4550.73	4552.4	EN2001a.B.spurt.240 Oh thank you very singer utterance yeah	4553.81	4556.06	EN2001a.B.spurt.241 it depends on what you want	4556.06	4557.35	EN2001a.B.spurt.242
B: access probably this file and then they display the words so why should we be able to do that	1155.44	1160.9	EN2001b.C.spurt.416 uh um graphical display initially this for are experimenting which is place them in different ways	2863.05	2867.24	EN2001b.B.spurt.999 To get just a single well you put a segment	2990.26	2992.6	EN2001b.B.spurt.1041 Would be quite easy would	1054.29	1055.58	EN2001b.C.spurt.378
C: Red green blue just why not a three	2429.77	2432.0	EN2001d.D.spurt.878 They can be can be red one	2581.63	2583.53	EN2001d.A.spurt.940 yours in mind "'cause" you also sort of give just a segment ideas	1034.86	1038.5	EN2001d.B.spurt.355 Is not to be difficult to do in terms of uh	844.38	847.11	EN2001d.D.spurt.295
D: What they are at the moment	173.29	174.36	EN2001e.B.spurt.39 Trying to get something working and then we can pick problems So at the moment mean i can we should be the state of you can load don't	224.3	230.77	EN2001e.B.spurt.51 so at the moment	637.32	638.5	EN2001e.B.spurt.127 And i think we should probably increase the the the moment sir point one seconds	1856.35	1860.03	EN2001e.B.spurt.388
A: Yeah i i do that but it's just stream any position to	4559.59	4562.9	EN2001a.B.spurt.243 I mean i would just	4563.81	4565.2	EN2001a.B.spurt.244 Sure	4569.44	4569.99	EN2001a.B.spurt.245 No i didn't use uh	4582.41	4584.05	EN2001a.B.spurt.246
B: Otherwise it's too easy to just plates things happen to be in this and they wouldn't be any work at all in terms of programming or something	1672.97	1681.73	EN2001b.C.spurt.605 Yeah it because then it would be quite easy to	1876.1	1879.19	EN2001b.A.spurt.665 yeah i see that yeah that's true so that it's easy if you	2736.3	2738.92	EN2001b.B.spurt.954 It's easy to match	2781.81	2782.87	EN2001b.A.spurt.968
C: Well that could be quite difficult i would have to take over	1698.45	1701.26	EN2001d.C.spurt.606 Act numbers	2596.31	2597.62	EN2001d.A.spurt.947 As an i just don't understand much more difficult just to do	2648.5	2651.71	EN2001d.B.spurt.964 Then it will not be significantly more difficult	2964.29	2966.71	EN2001d.B.spurt.1081
D: Um and at the moment it can make any difference is between i mean you get	2044.78	2050.65	EN2001e.A.spurt.440 Not at the moment	2965.09	2966.27	EN2001e.B.spurt.708 "'cause" you reckon that you could leave them in and they would never show up in a summary anyway	468.9	473.15	EN2001e.B.spurt.103 Yeah something like that and then just be sure that summary you mean there	520.72	523.81	EN2001e.B.spurt.111
A: huh	4584.05	4584.28	EN2001a.B.spurt.247 And you would one that all in one five	4606.51	4609.58	EN2001a.B.spurt.248 For all the corporate as well	4610.01	4612.07	EN2001a.B.spurt.249 For the series	4614.06	4615.14	EN2001a.B.spurt.250
B: I think it really easy if we don't merge them beforehand but if we let them	3407.64	3410.92	EN2001b.B.spurt.1190 So i i would need to separate files for you it's segmenter just maybe have to limit us in between each segment	239.5	246.35	EN2001b.C.spurt.95 I think just the segments as uh segmented in the	424.05	427.16	EN2001b.A.spurt.161 The mobile like this and they are they uh segments in what sense for what's the definition of a segment then	605.24	610.24	EN2001b.B.spurt.239
C: On improving they information estimation so do you think there'll be a point when you say	1639.66	1643.9	EN2001d.B.spurt.589 Well that's that's that we have we have an information and veg score and	1644.45	1647.86	EN2001d.B.spurt.590 it information	1883.04	1883.94	EN2001d.D.spurt.697 This place to put it	626.26	627.25	EN2001d.C.spurt.223
D: So that to come back to the prom it before so the reason why the summary it didn't work well in the last one works well now is because	1439.06	1445.19	EN2001e.B.spurt.282 He has that there is for re summary of the frame problem	3364.27	3367.34	EN2001e.B.spurt.779 The summary line	3928.34	3928.94	EN2001e.B.spurt.881 In the um x. m. s. i. and just No put it there i did you	598.45	602.98	EN2001e.A.spurt.118
A: Yeah i kind eighty put it through	4620.19	4622.05	EN2001a.B.spurt.251 So uh only words	4626.57	4628.5	EN2001a.B.spurt.252 It's	4648.15	4648.9	EN2001a.B.spurt.254 Yeah they were	4650.39	4651.11	EN2001a.B.spurt.255
B: i mean one segment of less is sometimes to segment of mine that's just what that meant	1273.0	1277.73	EN2001b.A.spurt.455 Sort of segment but not quite segment days	2471.93	2474.52	EN2001b.B.spurt.863 Or produced the data that we are producing	143.78	146.18	EN2001b.B.spurt.64 Let me your data on oh	221.35	222.97	EN2001b.C.spurt.86
C: Did you um take it from From my directory or to have to put it in the shop	639.37	644.39	EN2001d.C.spurt.227 "'cause" are we gonna have some kind of tree v.	781.04	783.51	EN2001d.D.spurt.275 You would do a search for wood or trend would recommend just the specific make it would go right to the up trend tried	1060.95	1065.94	EN2001d.B.spurt.364 No idea how advanced we gonna have a search so it definitely should restrict it to	1100.04	1104.57	EN2001d.D.spurt.377
D: Is there any way for x. for putting the sound yeah	1292.79	1295.72	EN2001e.B.spurt.254 Well it depends mean we could link in some cases you could put it is a feature and say you know you can dynamically	2158.37	2163.21	EN2001e.B.spurt.484 Just put a certain graphic light "'em" like a handshake or something cool	2185.05	2189.61	EN2001e.B.spurt.495 You know what i think we should put the threshold for that one in the end quite high anyway so probably does make much of a difference because i think this thing	2425.86	2432.48	EN2001e.B.spurt.578
A: Just i will just take a with a take over the names they have anyway	4651.52	4656.51	EN2001a.B.spurt.256 Yeah yeah	4661.08	4661.45	EN2001a.B.spurt.257 Yeah	4662.78	4663.27	EN2001a.B.spurt.258 once there is a has a um same three starting it was so	4663.27	4667.35	EN2001a.B.spurt.259
B: But do we have enough and from that enough data or four	1786.62	1789.53	EN2001b.A.spurt.637 You know data intensive	3108.35	3109.87	EN2001b.A.spurt.1077 I i mean i i actually have to look at the data what causes these um	3233.25	3237.11	EN2001b.A.spurt.1133 So i mean you are be happy with some data even	3392.89	3395.84	EN2001b.A.spurt.1186
C: I'm not convinced you get any kind of good quality some uh yeah	1423.38	1426.44	EN2001d.D.spurt.523 For the search results are probably think that instead of	1447.52	1449.93	EN2001d.B.spurt.532 As well be quite cool is it on the search for so	1468.91	1471.11	EN2001d.D.spurt.541 I have most of the stuff that i i'm doing now um rid of that putting the the station	1835.33	1839.62	EN2001d.B.spurt.677
D: Okay so what i think we really do have to put the threshold quite	2525.01	2528.09	EN2001e.B.spurt.602 Very good You could put one point one or the other one to pick up to one	3842.97	3846.77	EN2001e.B.spurt.864 So the presentation is no she	936.06	937.93	EN2001e.B.spurt.191 Presentation it's exactly in two weeks	937.26	939.18	EN2001e.A.spurt.192
A: So only words and but sometimes	4669.09	4671.48	EN2001a.B.spurt.260 And you	4672.1	4672.45	EN2001a.B.spurt.261 Yeah you wanted are that's okay	4677.89	4679.93	EN2001a.B.spurt.262 yeah	4679.93	4680.06	EN2001a.B.spurt.263
B: Yeah but what is an utterance uh	420.65	423.28	EN2001b.C.spurt.158 So what we what we fit fit in into the x. m. l. files would it be at uh the value for each utterance all which you	429.96	436.87	EN2001b.C.spurt.166 You have a look on i. d. for each Utterance	498.64	501.2	EN2001b.D.spurt.202 I suppose so but utterances by also includes things like like	609.26	612.9	EN2001b.D.spurt.240
C: As we are kind of Make the idea that he	1862.15	1865.25	EN2001d.D.spurt.689 It is nice and it comes to put down	3201.03	3202.7	EN2001d.B.spurt.1155 Is putting on a sense way to go out and possibly threshold yeah	3227.56	3230.79	EN2001d.D.spurt.1167 Yeah so it's some kind of slash older this	3239.73	3242.09	EN2001d.C.spurt.1170
D: Yeah that that's just the three taste it in the presentation and that	966.02	969.88	EN2001e.A.spurt.202 No we have to present "'cause" some of them are also i mean this is just added by different speakers for example there	2625.68	2631.95	EN2001e.A.spurt.633 Write a program that looks for everything a number and test the mapping for that	368.48	372.05	EN2001e.A.spurt.89 Test does that offend the first have to fight for	1678.36	1681.17	EN2001e.A.spurt.334
A: "'kay" any i	4680.87	4681.72	EN2001a.B.spurt.264 Yeah and do you want	4688.08	4689.47	EN2001a.B.spurt.266 Yeah sometimes they are contained in one another So	4690.97	4694.56	EN2001a.B.spurt.267 Just after them uh-huh	4696.4	4697.6	EN2001a.B.spurt.268
B: Oh the the utterances it in that um	1138.28	1140.85	EN2001b.C.spurt.409 It's probably not much to talk about the moment in terms of	126.26	129.33	EN2001b.B.spurt.59 Not sure what software i have at the moment	316.29	318.79	EN2001b.B.spurt.126 At the moment	1297.4	1298.21	EN2001b.B.spurt.459
C: And then we'll put those things together	3336.69	3338.31	EN2001d.B.spurt.1203 and you know it doesn't matter twos one child can trust	234.38	237.38	EN2001d.A.spurt.70 certain threshold a half or a special to us	274.04	277.91	EN2001d.C.spurt.88 Yeah but but Perhaps more than half	490.34	492.39	EN2001d.A.spurt.170
D: yeah exciting perfect when testing	2024.85	2026.68	EN2001e.A.spurt.434 If we we we should have a test at the day before	3548.27	3550.5	EN2001e.B.spurt.819 What i'm having is	5.51	6.57	EN2001e.B.spurt.2 If if if you have two objects and you say object if you say a equals be They see reference to the same thing	27.38	33.35	EN2001e.B.spurt.7
A: Okay	4698.78	4699.12	EN2001a.B.spurt.269 Okay	4700.31	4700.85	EN2001a.B.spurt.270 Or it's	4701.66	4702.55	EN2001a.B.spurt.271 Um and i think um	4727.23	4728.75	EN2001a.B.spurt.272
B: So there there at the moment so	1507.92	1510.07	EN2001b.B.spurt.533 so you've spoken about topic at the moment	1621.59	1623.37	EN2001b.B.spurt.584 So the moment you you just	3147.06	3148.21	EN2001b.B.spurt.1094 Yeah but i did at the moment as um	3153.81	3155.72	EN2001b.A.spurt.1097
C: Finetuned They're matters	3058.38	3060.35	EN2001d.B.spurt.1112 Yeah so it it shouldn't like even if you even if if we have to extend that are gonna choose just be a matter of	3125.7	3131.02	EN2001d.B.spurt.1132 yeah that's an a little old versions that it shows and	374.75	377.55	EN2001d.B.spurt.134 First version of the text think	427.88	429.98	EN2001d.A.spurt.154
D: Say change to make it a one i made to the other and if you do that around five quarters you lose track of in use only wonder why they values zero and it turns out that this era because it's the same thing that you	33.86	43.48	EN2001e.B.spurt.8 Yeah	34.49	34.79	EN2001e.A.spurt.9 Anyway um	44.09	45.16	EN2001e.B.spurt.10 so we think about	45.16	46.12	EN2001e.B.spurt.11
A: To have	4734.71	4735.27	EN2001a.B.spurt.274 Means that it should be similar to have the words	4735.78	4738.75	EN2001a.B.spurt.275 That be	4739.41	4739.91	EN2001a.B.spurt.276 Now um	4742.14	4743.13	EN2001a.B.spurt.277
B: Get to the point we understand enough to really few that i don't know i'm not feeling that i'm really working at the moment which is trying to make sense of everything	3349.97	3356.75	EN2001b.B.spurt.1173 Obviously feeling this like this at what the callings and for	78.15	81.5	EN2001b.B.spurt.40 Yeah well but that's the way worse it's called dollars in between them are the boundaries but	245.65	249.89	EN2001b.D.spurt.97 Is it called is that	476.84	477.7	EN2001b.B.spurt.188
C: Yes like you you they would only be one but if you're dating you could just overwrite the version if you want	2729.59	2734.09	EN2001d.B.spurt.996 "'cause" you don't have different versions or very well	2979.35	2981.88	EN2001d.B.spurt.1086 No at the moment the application is	87.33	89.51	EN2001d.B.spurt.17 If we see anything at all then we see at the moment at least that	358.17	360.89	EN2001d.B.spurt.125
D: Anyway so	79.2	80.2	EN2001e.B.spurt.17 Uh let's just see what happens	80.91	82.18	EN2001e.B.spurt.18 And the end we did get it working	83.86	85.59	EN2001e.B.spurt.19 Okay	88.53	88.98	EN2001e.B.spurt.20
A: That's what i i'm guessing that's you know um	4749.61	4752.61	EN2001a.B.spurt.279 what i because nine men about this what i got four	4752.61	4755.62	EN2001a.B.spurt.280 When i i i said for every	4756.2	4757.74	EN2001a.B.spurt.281 Um i trends this is goes from that but um	4758.05	4761.08	EN2001a.B.spurt.282
B: Could just tried to call um	1076.01	1078.55	EN2001b.A.spurt.385 You can adjust these calls ones blank	1268.55	1270.38	EN2001b.D.spurt.452 Surely and fifty call that i've wrote some of the project and	1693.54	1696.02	EN2001b.B.spurt.609 Yeah i think call and gave me will actually work on on the job uh stuff in it	3297.3	3301.41	EN2001b.B.spurt.1157
C: It does something like at the moment i think this was	372.0	374.03	EN2001d.B.spurt.131 what the moment it's just that an old file	644.19	646.85	EN2001d.D.spurt.229 We have ten with the speaker at the moment	1117.53	1119.21	EN2001d.B.spurt.388 At the moment and just whenever it needs to be repainted are not think about what to do in just repainting the thing as a whole	1562.36	1567.99	EN2001d.B.spurt.570
D: Yeah	90.27	90.88	EN2001e.B.spurt.21 Yeah	92.45	93.25	EN2001e.B.spurt.22 I was in a hurry complete mess of like split	98.02	100.45	EN2001e.B.spurt.23 Yes but that's not what we wanted to	106.55	108.36	EN2001e.B.spurt.25
A: Takes	4762.88	4763.3	EN2001a.B.spurt.283 Seconds	4764.1	4764.68	EN2001a.B.spurt.284 Oh	4767.85	4768.16	EN2001a.B.spurt.285 Yeah i mean	4768.96	4769.67	EN2001a.B.spurt.286
B: I can give you an idea but it be quite difficult i should give a topic "'kay"	258.03	261.64	EN2001b.D.spurt.104 I mean uh for me it's quite difficult to say on	372.34	375.96	EN2001b.A.spurt.141 It wouldn't be difficult to	1189.22	1190.99	EN2001b.A.spurt.424 But this is by speaking you trace it slightly more difficult	1359.52	1362.48	EN2001b.B.spurt.479
C: Um actually at the moment i don't see how many people can work on on the programming anyway	1678.38	1683.94	EN2001d.B.spurt.598 This is sent at the moment when they say it's too much reach should be question of copying it over and over right	1908.1	1912.99	EN2001d.B.spurt.708 Well at the moment from they don't follow	2108.42	2111.05	EN2001d.D.spurt.776 Ah okay the moment i don't even train right i mean do quite a document for those	2339.56	2343.9	EN2001d.A.spurt.852
D: So but i think okay	108.92	110.89	EN2001e.B.spurt.26 this is another one and	110.89	112.3	EN2001e.B.spurt.27 If you three sets this	112.7	113.79	EN2001e.B.spurt.28 Um	127.61	128.29	EN2001e.B.spurt.31
A: Two and four of "'em"	4770.59	4771.72	EN2001a.B.spurt.287 Doesn't matter	4772.79	4773.35	EN2001a.B.spurt.288 Yeah i mean uh i hope that would be the same for the words	4790.57	4793.7	EN2001a.B.spurt.289 It's just that uh	4794.5	4795.31	EN2001a.B.spurt.290
B: But you probably be more difficult for map	2640.38	2642.24	EN2001b.B.spurt.914 That would be quite difficult but yeah	2849.38	2851.27	EN2001b.A.spurt.991 Difficult to	3348.58	3349.35	EN2001b.B.spurt.1172 Because it would then say how would find that it	1467.27	1470.0	EN2001b.A.spurt.517
C: Is anyone providing that at the moment and designer	2571.04	2573.27	EN2001d.B.spurt.934 "'cause" at the moment we all produce	2601.02	2602.64	EN2001d.A.spurt.950 At the moment	3119.17	3119.81	EN2001d.D.spurt.1127 So this this one week after my dissertation so we've had before the presentation of the prototype	763.75	768.59	EN2001d.B.spurt.271
D: Yeah	162.4	162.73	EN2001e.A.spurt.36 Like if you if you First if you read through this um recently read suspiciously fluid like this and	163.76	169.41	EN2001e.B.spurt.37 They seem to all	174.8	175.64	EN2001e.B.spurt.40 Yes	184.61	185.55	EN2001e.B.spurt.41
A: It's a	4827.02	4827.55	EN2001a.B.spurt.291 So um	4828.31	4829.04	EN2001a.B.spurt.292 i probably sends um	4829.04	4830.86	EN2001a.B.spurt.293 To all those need it so let you can have a look well that's what you want	4835.47	4839.34	EN2001a.B.spurt.295
B: Find a way how to	2273.3	2274.45	EN2001b.B.spurt.807 Would you be able to find out which word that is	2685.69	2688.16	EN2001b.B.spurt.934 Or but i don't i don't really have an idea like what otherwise what we would do today in this meeting i mean	209.6	214.6	EN2001b.B.spurt.82 this number of references of others because the meeting	856.43	858.86	EN2001b.A.spurt.315
C: Just because it's for us like more bureaucracy more complexity new probably just won't give us any brownie points to the presentation	812.93	818.79	EN2001d.B.spurt.284 Also present that and	903.55	905.11	EN2001d.A.spurt.316 Just before the presentation	1832.72	1834.1	EN2001d.B.spurt.675 We well we want to use f. t. or when it's present	2372.26	2375.07	EN2001d.D.spurt.861
D: So maybe that's for the problem is coming from	187.29	189.49	EN2001e.B.spurt.42 Yeah	191.15	191.51	EN2001e.B.spurt.43 Um	191.86	192.65	EN2001e.B.spurt.44 Um	200.75	201.39	EN2001e.B.spurt.46
A: Yeah	4849.47	4849.74	EN2001a.B.spurt.297 What do you have to demonstrate	5049.54	5050.81	EN2001a.B.spurt.298 Uh-huh	5102.72	5103.2	EN2001a.B.spurt.299
B: Each meeting	1635.81	1636.94	EN2001b.C.spurt.591 For me words per meeting	1818.72	1820.26	EN2001b.B.spurt.643 From from beginning to end point like that in one meeting there are several topics	2056.92	2061.21	EN2001b.B.spurt.733 Yes but across meetings	2062.23	2063.79	EN2001b.A.spurt.734
C: We could just to for all sorts of stuff like that but in the presentation the thing we deliberately tried to keep any complexity and numbers and stuff away from people	3163.83	3171.9	EN2001d.B.spurt.1148 No no yeah it's just it's the top round ones uh	276.28	279.49	EN2001d.D.spurt.89 Yeah no this is very old which it never pour the top that's that because we were working on	427.07	430.83	EN2001d.B.spurt.153 It doesn't seem to work very well if "'kay" for slowing down to go to a bit speaking out of those into one two	1287.95	1293.75	EN2001d.D.spurt.472
D: i'm i'm gonna show this just what we have fit the mold it not gonna look	209.72	213.16	EN2001e.B.spurt.48 Okay	232.94	233.35	EN2001e.B.spurt.52 But from monday or my can't just do twenty four seven for this one Until it and desist you	240.98	246.25	EN2001e.B.spurt.54 Yes yeah	254.15	254.66	EN2001e.B.spurt.56
B: And they very quite by d. even for the same speaker close meetings	3048.58	3053.5	EN2001b.A.spurt.1059 There's probably also soft interaction factors know the sometimes just a meeting like	3072.45	3076.05	EN2001b.B.spurt.1066 I think it needed more than half an hour continuum of the left have enough to do it for a meetings	3118.57	3124.52	EN2001b.A.spurt.1085 no one there you press pick up the meeting	3180.99	3184.23	EN2001b.A.spurt.1110
C: As a that's a bit annoying "'cause" like is more how we could require a couple something together and just said look great	1720.21	1725.96	EN2001d.D.spurt.620 Well as well then it's it's a bit	2740.31	2741.85	EN2001d.D.spurt.999 No it just takes the top like twenty or fifty euro oh okay	3236.34	3240.78	EN2001d.D.spurt.1169 I'll be down this can be off the the data than just by	294.02	297.94	EN2001d.D.spurt.98
D: Okay	257.04	257.63	EN2001e.B.spurt.57 E. k.	275.55	276.36	EN2001e.B.spurt.59 And that's it	277.97	278.73	EN2001e.B.spurt.60 But	280.7	280.98	EN2001e.B.spurt.61
B: So Would you would be feeding it would be just like one well you press pick up the meeting so that	3190.43	3194.97	EN2001b.B.spurt.1113 i had a sick Jonathan if we can postpone the meeting to one o'clock	3310.49	3315.0	EN2001b.B.spurt.1161 So that would give us a chance of meeting um for our before	3315.94	3318.56	EN2001b.B.spurt.1163 So this whole information i would tend store in this	1008.74	1011.35	EN2001b.B.spurt.365
C: So you want to send steve the prototype and we should change the data now it's the best	620.28	625.52	EN2001d.C.spurt.221 And the data match what then	2272.26	2273.71	EN2001d.B.spurt.819 If the data is a four	2541.49	2542.74	EN2001d.D.spurt.922 Data	2921.13	2921.64	EN2001d.D.spurt.1064
D: Sometimes you have to	281.71	282.65	EN2001e.B.spurt.62 Take whatever you get an interesting for you	283.27	285.97	EN2001e.B.spurt.63 Ah	290.42	290.59	EN2001e.B.spurt.64 Yeah it's uh it's perhaps uh in the meantime talk about the um	292.97	297.76	EN2001e.A.spurt.65
B: Saying that's what we bring in information dance t.	1026.89	1029.48	EN2001b.B.spurt.369 Because otherwise in the in the other things there's no information about what the participant names and so on	1117.75	1123.34	EN2001b.A.spurt.403 But every word just just about picking that doesn't always it's the same information and you in your thing with this depended position like	1324.84	1331.24	EN2001b.B.spurt.467 it with your Addition information you want	1392.31	1394.73	EN2001b.A.spurt.487
C: I read them into separate to raise and then you can just change it like this one which wanna get that	322.39	328.43	EN2001d.D.spurt.111 Try there are cream the what's does anyone know but this you in separation thing like what uh	2468.29	2473.1	EN2001d.B.spurt.900 And then do them separately	3278.07	3279.42	EN2001d.D.spurt.1182 Because yeah it's much quicker for both working separately i think	3309.21	3312.4	EN2001d.D.spurt.1193
D: Um	302.94	303.36	EN2001e.A.spurt.67 Yeah i i didn't know that you Left out those	303.78	307.56	EN2001e.A.spurt.68 Would don't have words so i just extracted be extradited numbers and the problem is	308.05	314.08	EN2001e.A.spurt.69 Um	314.72	315.47	EN2001e.A.spurt.70
B: Yeah what what the problem is that i don't know exactly i think the information came in rainbow is	1491.13	1497.34	EN2001b.C.spurt.528 The value of the information gained not	1499.48	1501.44	EN2001b.C.spurt.530 Uh it's all about information again i don't know where the words come from because it's it has a bag of words were presentation	1516.26	1523.63	EN2001b.C.spurt.535 Least like expressive it might contain less information	1772.51	1775.8	EN2001b.B.spurt.633
C: No the the interesting thing is the sound came when i tried last time off try	100.92	104.91	EN2001d.B.spurt.23 See you have time this afternoon	348.86	350.27	EN2001d.B.spurt.120 i just i think it was like cindy much time on that	682.3	684.55	EN2001d.D.spurt.243 You just make sure that if it takes quite some time that	708.69	711.12	EN2001d.B.spurt.252
D: it's perhaps a more	315.47	317.0	EN2001e.A.spurt.71 Um	317.95	318.59	EN2001e.A.spurt.72 Dangerous to Get mistaken as o.'s numbers and	319.37	323.25	EN2001e.A.spurt.73 Not knowing why Things happen if we just developed numbers and	324.03	328.33	EN2001e.A.spurt.74
B: Probably one points euro is very high information right yeah	2001.72	2004.43	EN2001b.B.spurt.712 But we don't have that information anywhere to be	2068.48	2070.83	EN2001b.B.spurt.736 Um they his information then be useful for a know where know	2132.62	2136.07	EN2001b.A.spurt.767 Yeah it's possible thing to keep it in topics with some more information	2166.86	2170.43	EN2001b.D.spurt.778
C: Yeah it really is a just dump out of time pre-final	743.82	746.54	EN2001d.D.spurt.265 But it would probably even be shorter than five times likely just kidding I thinking one or two	1435.99	1441.03	EN2001d.B.spurt.529 You see provided that out calculations of like Where we are in time in here or correct and that's just something that isn't tested so far	1615.05	1622.7	EN2001d.B.spurt.585 I think it takes us the first time Sixty percent or yeah	1760.07	1764.29	EN2001d.D.spurt.636
D: Make a new	328.78	329.49	EN2001e.A.spurt.75 Yeah	330.04	330.45	EN2001e.A.spurt.76 No	335.52	335.83	EN2001e.B.spurt.77 Yeah sure but i mean	335.96	337.28	EN2001e.A.spurt.78
B: Much information	2235.5	2236.6	EN2001b.B.spurt.799 You get the information out of	2481.92	2483.49	EN2001b.A.spurt.866 The information about uh how how important is this	2496.6	2499.89	EN2001b.A.spurt.874 And then you would that your information on two individual works	2673.17	2676.48	EN2001b.B.spurt.930
C: I don't wanna do like three like three internal times customers just giving nancy	2865.81	2869.55	EN2001d.B.spurt.1043 So they would all be in the same time so	2899.3	2901.16	EN2001d.D.spurt.1055 We should certainly take way the labels it's a minus four times as well	3176.8	3180.46	EN2001d.D.spurt.1150 So it may say five to seven that should be enough time	3302.89	3305.83	EN2001d.D.spurt.1191
D: For all those matters that are based on words um	338.22	341.26	EN2001e.A.spurt.79 I can automatically	341.57	342.67	EN2001e.A.spurt.80 So um	347.98	348.78	EN2001e.A.spurt.82 Um they have the duration	352.45	354.08	EN2001e.A.spurt.84
B: Yeah no no i put up	806.61	807.66	EN2001b.A.spurt.296 That's it then put one um the them do	945.26	947.8	EN2001b.A.spurt.346 Put it up yes	1232.08	1233.26	EN2001b.A.spurt.440 But would you do not get that to put your words for every speaker	1457.54	1460.86	EN2001b.A.spurt.512
C: I might want to hire more spend like saying that time and low it's	3317.65	3321.42	EN2001d.D.spurt.1196 We should preset it's always a risk that such an easy uh-huh	89.77	92.86	EN2001d.D.spurt.18 It's quite easy to do that so i think we probably should	1228.85	1231.55	EN2001d.D.spurt.441 how we do you know how easy is the point two things	1462.11	1465.13	EN2001d.D.spurt.537
D: You know they don't have the word	354.93	356.66	EN2001e.A.spurt.85 Um so for my i'll have a measures uh	357.46	360.46	EN2001e.A.spurt.86 yeah i get them and i've done i mean i would have to	360.46	363.99	EN2001e.A.spurt.87 Look for every single	365.41	366.85	EN2001e.A.spurt.88
B: Yeah i am what it actually does is that you you put in some	1547.53	1551.84	EN2001b.C.spurt.545 You can really do any other uh i put	2105.31	2106.94	EN2001b.D.spurt.754 So that leap because in the end we don't wanna put work there's a problem for second place	2720.22	2724.22	EN2001b.B.spurt.946 Interface between the having the topic segments and	229.84	233.01	EN2001b.C.spurt.91
C: So i think it should be quite easy	1497.88	1499.61	EN2001d.D.spurt.551 We can easy had to come on line parameter	1914.69	1917.5	EN2001d.D.spurt.711 Is is is easy to like that but she just to it	2050.64	2053.53	EN2001d.D.spurt.758 As well so that's one that was quite easy	2696.19	2698.46	EN2001d.C.spurt.984
D: Yes	376.94	377.37	EN2001e.A.spurt.90 Must that	381.53	382.4	EN2001e.A.spurt.91 Uh-huh	386.23	386.5	EN2001e.A.spurt.92 Uh just one but	393.75	394.99	EN2001e.A.spurt.93
B: Yeah if you have to do that you're using you need uh a label for each segment	250.75	254.66	EN2001b.D.spurt.100 Boundaries of segments at all	403.63	405.45	EN2001b.C.spurt.154 And it's not segments Was it dialogue that can look at	474.82	478.69	EN2001b.D.spurt.185 Each segment um	544.83	546.83	EN2001b.A.spurt.215
C: To add to know that a lot that window is really easy	2790.62	2793.47	EN2001d.D.spurt.1017 How easy would it be to make it you can add of the tree numbers of them	2946.78	2950.31	EN2001d.D.spurt.1076 That's easy "'cause" one can take it any number	2992.61	2995.3	EN2001d.D.spurt.1091 Should be easy	3053.71	3054.5	EN2001d.D.spurt.1110
D: Um	395.36	396.16	EN2001e.A.spurt.94 why do you think it's necessary at all sort of that	396.16	398.75	EN2001e.A.spurt.95 Yeah and it's a problem with the snow	404.53	406.44	EN2001e.A.spurt.96 But actually i think there is something in the audio shouldn't uh if there's um	412.13	417.14	EN2001e.A.spurt.97
B: That um that's really all segments i mean it's it can be words What topics are um	547.27	552.96	EN2001b.A.spurt.216 And that's usually dialogue what what's different a beeping problems dialogue acts in between segmenter have done	619.05	624.57	EN2001b.B.spurt.245 So we met would need a value label for each of those Segments	680.6	685.28	EN2001b.C.spurt.266 But i think these segments was was not exactly what you're looking at because that's just what	730.38	735.52	EN2001b.A.spurt.274
C: Two and whatever check if that's actually good meeting like or	606.32	608.69	EN2001d.B.spurt.216 And uh so the only problem of the first meeting it's very uh um that there's no um	625.89	631.5	EN2001d.A.spurt.222 To represent the meetings and stuff	784.15	786.7	EN2001d.D.spurt.276 You know all that sort of thing through meetings	831.12	833.95	EN2001d.A.spurt.291
D: In the other side word i think in the idea of the way	417.65	420.37	EN2001e.A.spurt.98 Be something at that point because it consideration	421.01	423.72	EN2001e.A.spurt.99 So you credit i was	437.79	440.03	EN2001e.A.spurt.100 Yeah i mean but why do you have a special and then follows	479.58	482.36	EN2001e.A.spurt.104
B: And those segments have i did have an i. d.	938.21	940.55	EN2001b.B.spurt.343 Links to the segment and then have an additional	967.86	970.26	EN2001b.B.spurt.350 Like for each source of our segments having just the i. d.	998.37	1001.76	EN2001b.B.spurt.363 The segments and	1136.16	1137.6	EN2001b.C.spurt.408
C: So we should at least provide an overview of different meetings of one group at the beginning he	835.74	841.16	EN2001d.A.spurt.292 As one meeting yeah	851.25	852.53	EN2001d.B.spurt.298 There's one meeting	851.61	852.59	EN2001d.D.spurt.299 This one know and do we do it across meetings	905.56	908.32	EN2001d.A.spurt.317
D: Stressed	483.2	483.8	EN2001e.A.spurt.105 Yeah	489.75	490.01	EN2001e.A.spurt.106 Yeah and it's just a question i wanted to uh this uh	493.73	497.7	EN2001e.A.spurt.107 Where	507.77	508.05	EN2001e.B.spurt.108
B: for my a segment of a um	1216.27	1218.28	EN2001b.A.spurt.434 Segments	1254.26	1254.95	EN2001b.B.spurt.448 No but but see you you a segment yeah	2084.91	2086.76	EN2001b.B.spurt.745 Yeah but you may k. i. so i'm segment similarity i think that was I i thought it would	2085.3	2090.26	EN2001b.A.spurt.746
C: Yeah so no it's i've finished all the meetings i think	1690.53	1693.29	EN2001d.C.spurt.604 Where one meeting is in no	2042.3	2043.9	EN2001d.C.spurt.755 No i think it makes more sense there's a whole corpus because the meets the um	2065.73	2069.66	EN2001d.D.spurt.762 the different meeting series overlap	2307.28	2309.61	EN2001d.C.spurt.839
D: Wouldn't you think that	508.91	509.96	EN2001e.B.spurt.109 Hmm	534.23	534.87	EN2001e.B.spurt.113 Okay sure that they could you could occurrences	569.83	571.68	EN2001e.B.spurt.114 Yeah yes	570.83	571.53	EN2001e.A.spurt.115
B: To each of those segments	2500.36	2502.36	EN2001b.A.spurt.875 And the segments to overlap	2763.47	2764.81	EN2001b.B.spurt.960 My segments a whatever in the same way as there's two but sometimes i have um	2772.51	2778.02	EN2001b.A.spurt.965 True that segments	2786.16	2787.54	EN2001b.A.spurt.972
C: R. and sometimes not for every meeting um	2326.42	2329.37	EN2001d.A.spurt.846 That's uh the one i watched are we are ways to talk about using that one meeting there which is in our we talk what's what that's what swapping know switching	2531.28	2538.51	EN2001d.B.spurt.920 Of the meeting	2598.34	2598.95	EN2001d.A.spurt.948 A picture of uh dog sitting in a field instead of uh meeting browser	3195.63	3199.95	EN2001d.B.spurt.1154
D: So um	589.14	589.98	EN2001e.A.spurt.116 Okay	613.42	613.85	EN2001e.A.spurt.119 Okay you and i was this	614.51	615.99	EN2001e.A.spurt.120 Yeah it is actually this is just champing know	615.74	617.99	EN2001e.B.spurt.121
B: Like for each for each of the uh segments	2791.29	2793.46	EN2001b.B.spurt.975 Something on to their segments like just each if you provide one	2879.83	2883.17	EN2001b.B.spurt.1007 Onto exactly they're segments	2889.67	2891.24	EN2001b.B.spurt.1009 It's take it from where to where the segments go it should be	2897.79	2901.04	EN2001b.C.spurt.1011
C: It's a which we can meet at five and	3290.67	3293.25	EN2001d.B.spurt.1186 And a graphical display well i'm not sure	97.44	99.5	EN2001d.B.spurt.21 No it is On your display	248.97	251.18	EN2001d.D.spurt.77 In my display	256.08	256.92	EN2001d.B.spurt.80
D: Okay	616.47	616.85	EN2001e.A.spurt.122 Sorry	618.67	619.05	EN2001e.B.spurt.123 Um	636.79	637.32	EN2001e.B.spurt.126 The configuration is that	639.79	641.5	EN2001e.B.spurt.128
B: And you say you think you're able as well to map and those segments	2997.76	3000.94	EN2001b.B.spurt.1044 Ah	1.52	1.86	EN2001b.A.spurt.1 Okay	2.14	2.58	EN2001b.B.spurt.2 Hmmm with that	3.06	4.58	EN2001b.A.spurt.3
C: Unfortunately i didn't get the the bar on the display working just can't	412.12	415.97	EN2001d.B.spurt.148 If we're not and make pre have to make a graphical display	793.55	796.58	EN2001d.D.spurt.279 Well i'm not So you think displaying like	931.56	934.75	EN2001d.B.spurt.326 So how we can display this uh	990.1	991.57	EN2001d.D.spurt.343
D: Yes but isn't that just	651.68	652.7	EN2001e.B.spurt.130 But i i i have some good	670.52	672.51	EN2001e.B.spurt.132 Different ways how you can	674.95	676.31	EN2001e.B.spurt.134 So there is	694.65	695.38	EN2001e.B.spurt.137
B: Oh	8.23	8.72	EN2001b.A.spurt.4 No	11.25	11.44	EN2001b.B.spurt.5 So	15.13	15.35	EN2001b.B.spurt.6 Yeah	17.4	17.5	EN2001b.B.spurt.7
C: but like probably that would be the same thing that we also display appear because i really think that having like some	1430.46	1435.42	EN2001d.B.spurt.528 Where like if this for the soldiers also then that's just like something else that's part number in when Must go so what this one it triggers that one to display it or something	1487.53	1494.63	EN2001d.B.spurt.548 I've never seen two trips displaying several lines the stuff that so i wonder how could they look but we we can try that	1505.97	1511.78	EN2001d.B.spurt.554 Small piece to have to just there's examples that um for doing stuff like that i just have to read up on it but yet displaying there	1606.56	1612.3	EN2001d.B.spurt.583
D: Uh-huh	701.55	701.87	EN2001e.A.spurt.139 Yeah sure we	704.83	705.33	EN2001e.B.spurt.141 Hmmm no it's not applying yeah	706.25	707.66	EN2001e.B.spurt.142 And	708.15	708.5	EN2001e.B.spurt.143
B: Uh	18.79	19.12	EN2001b.D.spurt.8 I	19.05	19.37	EN2001b.B.spurt.9 huh	19.12	19.5	EN2001b.D.spurt.10 Yeah	22.32	22.66	EN2001b.C.spurt.11
C: Change your things that could display uh	2809.03	2811.16	EN2001d.D.spurt.1022 No i like that different measures to the display	2953.62	2956.6	EN2001d.D.spurt.1079 Oh	0.54	0.95	EN2001d.A.spurt.1 Uh-huh	1.45	1.69	EN2001d.A.spurt.2
D: Um	726.59	727.3	EN2001e.B.spurt.146 So that's probably seen that people will not gonna go into any whatever base	727.98	731.72	EN2001e.B.spurt.147 Blah blah right	732.2	733.05	EN2001e.B.spurt.148 Mark of model blob blob a lot of combining them	733.52	736.24	EN2001e.B.spurt.149
B: Uh-huh	22.88	23.7	EN2001b.B.spurt.12 Uh-huh	25.21	26.39	EN2001b.B.spurt.13 Oh	27.74	27.8	EN2001b.B.spurt.14 I i it's i	28.93	30.9	EN2001b.A.spurt.15

D: No	736.77	737.31	EN2001e.A.spurt.150 Um that's probably what we go up to	737.35	739.22	EN2001e.B.spurt.151 So okay so	744.77	745.47	EN2001e.B.spurt.153 Yeah	752.71	753.13	EN2001e.B.spurt.155
B: Uh-huh	29.45	30.01	EN2001b.B.spurt.16 Mm	30.92	31.66	EN2001b.B.spurt.17 No	32.29	32.56	EN2001b.B.spurt.18 Uh-huh	33.33	34.0	EN2001b.B.spurt.19

D: I was going for	755.68	757.79	EN2001e.A.spurt.157 So uh let's see i was us to page user	764.83	767.75	EN2001e.B.spurt.159 And you see	779.26	779.92	EN2001e.B.spurt.161 This seems foolish this is again for the opposite of what we want it to be some value the chip like divide by one uh one divided the value something	793.97	800.9	EN2001e.B.spurt.164
B: Great can implement that	36.18	37.44	EN2001b.A.spurt.20 Oh okay	37.41	38.0	EN2001b.B.spurt.21 I	37.86	38.7	EN2001b.A.spurt.22 I know like just uh-huh	39.87	47.24	EN2001b.B.spurt.23
C: Yeah	62.79	63.55	EN2001d.B.spurt.12 i just a sort of like preparing people for and	63.55	65.93	EN2001d.B.spurt.13 Yes sure	92.37	93.15	EN2001d.B.spurt.19 We missing the sound	99.16	100.18	EN2001d.D.spurt.22
D: But um	801.37	802.12	EN2001e.B.spurt.165 Yes but also every other word and that sentence we should look at Are probably in your list of fifty like used to more potent words in the universe so	807.1	815.48	EN2001e.B.spurt.166 Yes it's probably just "'cause" if you look at the other one like if this is just there s. sentence for	817.3	822.55	EN2001e.B.spurt.167 Like having function words in a row	823.41	825.14	EN2001e.B.spurt.168
B: I	49.4	50.38	EN2001b.C.spurt.25 Uh-huh	50.57	51.39	EN2001b.B.spurt.26 Now if i	51.22	52.37	EN2001b.A.spurt.27 Okay	54.72	56.02	EN2001b.B.spurt.28
C: I'd trade off something like picking on something	105.52	107.98	EN2001d.B.spurt.24 Other yes	109.52	110.18	EN2001d.D.spurt.25 Yeah there something like um production slow the learning	109.73	112.43	EN2001d.B.spurt.26 And the turn of the buttons yeah	113.45	114.62	EN2001d.B.spurt.27
D: If i promise not that is something break in thirty and eight and that sort of ringing of the colour	837.56	841.95	EN2001e.B.spurt.170 Yeah	848.53	848.98	EN2001e.B.spurt.171 Yeah still it's uh it's it's might be having some trouble i think this one over rent just before so we might still have some problem here that it's not stopping at the end but	850.8	858.68	EN2001e.B.spurt.172 So in case can you make the promising than i'm not making the promise realistically that because will very soon get	859.16	864.89	EN2001e.B.spurt.173
B: a uh-huh	56.02	57.18	EN2001b.B.spurt.29 Yeah	58.45	58.74	EN2001b.B.spurt.30 uh-huh	58.74	59.61	EN2001b.B.spurt.31 Mm	61.61	61.64	EN2001b.C.spurt.32

B: To be sure that we can	142.21	143.27	EN2001b.B.spurt.63 You know way you're it is i mean	146.7	148.69	EN2001b.B.spurt.65 I guess might get out reload in for greta different Where you're "'cause" it's matrix but	149.75	154.55	EN2001b.B.spurt.66 Maybe features sort of for what we know about the x. m. l. format can try to make sense of it	158.6	162.76	EN2001b.B.spurt.68
C: So are you basing um	272.56	274.04	EN2001d.C.spurt.87 Okay	278.62	279.15	EN2001d.C.spurt.90 Okay so what were you saying pro	279.99	281.48	EN2001d.B.spurt.91 Yeah well but it's just about	286.03	287.9	EN2001d.B.spurt.93
D: You think	1028.99	1029.57	EN2001e.B.spurt.217 Yeah	1030.07	1030.33	EN2001e.A.spurt.218 We should probably	1031.83	1032.57	EN2001e.B.spurt.219 For for that or like integrate it would chips that would be visible	1035.05	1038.62	EN2001e.B.spurt.220
B: No i don't it or know how to go about this	163.47	166.08	EN2001b.B.spurt.69 Um	168.26	169.25	EN2001b.B.spurt.70 What i did just now aside download it to	170.91	173.55	EN2001b.B.spurt.71 Um	180.6	181.1	EN2001b.B.spurt.72
C: I'll be above that	288.16	289.08	EN2001d.D.spurt.94 Uh	289.75	290.16	EN2001d.B.spurt.95 huh	290.16	290.46	EN2001d.B.spurt.96 Again	293.9	294.3	EN2001d.B.spurt.97
D: Having said that if we could probably would like if we want to go probably go back to the	1069.45	1073.98	EN2001e.B.spurt.221 Um	1074.37	1075.16	EN2001e.B.spurt.222 Probably	1085.57	1085.98	EN2001e.B.spurt.225 Yeah	1127.31	1127.87	EN2001e.A.spurt.226
B: i've downloaded some	181.1	183.14	EN2001b.B.spurt.73 Files some x. m. l. files	184.55	186.9	EN2001b.B.spurt.74 Right	187.29	187.58	EN2001b.D.spurt.75 And	188.23	188.85	EN2001b.B.spurt.76
C: In this maine in this routine	297.68	299.55	EN2001d.B.spurt.99 Yeah that	299.12	299.77	EN2001d.D.spurt.100 Yeah	308.18	308.66	EN2001d.D.spurt.103 She was for those around	309.19	310.42	EN2001d.B.spurt.104
D: but it's something	1127.87	1128.77	EN2001e.A.spurt.227 Um	1129.41	1130.1	EN2001e.B.spurt.228 What	1147.91	1148.21	EN2001e.B.spurt.229 We have is just a multiplying numbers it can be done in the problem "'cause" then we can	1152.47	1156.09	EN2001e.B.spurt.230
B: And then talk about how	200.42	202.17	EN2001b.B.spurt.78 Uh-huh	208.44	208.86	EN2001b.C.spurt.81 No just maybe talk about um	217.93	220.09	EN2001b.C.spurt.84 how you would	220.09	220.95	EN2001b.C.spurt.85
C: How work with that	309.58	310.65	EN2001d.D.spurt.105 Uh-huh	311.06	311.62	EN2001d.B.spurt.106 Yeah tried some whiskers	317.92	319.54	EN2001d.D.spurt.108 Or what what what's the difference so that	319.43	321.61	EN2001d.B.spurt.109
D: Um because what we could do is	1156.88	1159.26	EN2001e.B.spurt.231 How we can just have a slide bar which we can Read and write which is in the frame that type	1168.97	1174.67	EN2001e.B.spurt.233 That would be good you shouldn't be difficult to determine should just be	1175.09	1177.34	EN2001e.B.spurt.234 Yeah but it might be more difficult let's see	1180.98	1183.09	EN2001e.B.spurt.235
B: Yeah	222.77	223.18	EN2001b.D.spurt.87 Yes and uh	224.64	225.41	EN2001b.D.spurt.88 What's that part	226.76	227.54	EN2001b.B.spurt.89 That's tom	228.25	229.06	EN2001b.C.spurt.90
C: This is really	322.22	323.01	EN2001d.B.spurt.110 Yeah	325.52	325.98	EN2001d.B.spurt.112 So just for fun and round from now	329.74	331.78	EN2001d.B.spurt.113 Yeah if you want	332.02	332.73	EN2001d.D.spurt.114
D: Yeah	1204.43	1205.0	EN2001e.B.spurt.237 yeah	1205.0	1205.29	EN2001e.B.spurt.238 And another one for	1212.87	1214.28	EN2001e.B.spurt.240 Um	1216.14	1216.73	EN2001e.B.spurt.241
B: Uh-huh	233.07	233.64	EN2001b.B.spurt.92 Uh-huh	237.85	238.31	EN2001b.B.spurt.94 Alright	243.15	243.51	EN2001b.D.spurt.96 Okay	248.39	248.78	EN2001b.C.spurt.98
C: What the right thing	334.15	335.67	EN2001d.B.spurt.115 Uh should	336.24	336.78	EN2001d.D.spurt.116 I am can be really eva so maybe have to have we have here	341.79	344.53	EN2001d.B.spurt.117 Yeah i should make a new construct does it lets you set the flag	344.29	347.6	EN2001d.D.spurt.118
D: Yeah	1227.32	1227.99	EN2001e.B.spurt.243 yeah	1227.99	1228.42	EN2001e.B.spurt.244 Um	1230.84	1231.46	EN2001e.B.spurt.246 Okay	1258.69	1259.24	EN2001e.B.spurt.249
B: yeah and you then i can make file so that's	248.78	250.78	EN2001b.C.spurt.99 I mean the more secure	255.16	255.89	EN2001b.D.spurt.101 No i don't know No it yeah	255.6	257.68	EN2001b.C.spurt.102 You don't need a one	256.34	257.22	EN2001b.D.spurt.103
C: Uh-huh	346.67	347.22	EN2001d.B.spurt.119 Yeah	350.62	350.95	EN2001d.D.spurt.121 Yeah	351.24	351.69	EN2001d.B.spurt.122 So here	352.23	352.88	EN2001d.B.spurt.123
D: Mm	1289.84	1291.09	EN2001e.B.spurt.253 "'cause" that would be sort of a nice way to sit at home and have it	1298.97	1301.43	EN2001e.B.spurt.255 For what the sound at the lowest be great	1302.01	1304.6	EN2001e.B.spurt.256 To you i mean seeing that it's all broad band is falling the graphics quite okay	1305.6	1310.07	EN2001e.B.spurt.257
B: I just	261.73	262.16	EN2001b.C.spurt.106 Hmm	261.75	262.19	EN2001b.B.spurt.107 Title	262.06	262.53	EN2001b.D.spurt.108 I just need a title of the file it doesn't matter what it is	262.6	267.53	EN2001b.C.spurt.109
C: So this shows	356.13	357.72	EN2001d.B.spurt.124 Just because we have a different and um	364.84	366.84	EN2001d.B.spurt.127 See you see that	368.54	369.4	EN2001d.B.spurt.129 Um	370.01	370.72	EN2001d.B.spurt.130
D: It would probably	1310.46	1311.49	EN2001e.B.spurt.258 Like broad band twice	1312.02	1313.61	EN2001e.B.spurt.259 And with the price probably work out	1314.03	1315.59	EN2001e.B.spurt.260 Uh you know	1341.2	1341.65	EN2001e.B.spurt.262
B: Okay	267.6	267.93	EN2001b.D.spurt.110 Yeah that's a problem	268.48	269.25	EN2001b.D.spurt.111 Mm yes	282.49	283.14	EN2001b.A.spurt.114 Yes that's yeah but i mean that all very very similar although six nine five	299.89	305.03	EN2001b.A.spurt.117
C: Oh that's the old old one okay	373.64	375.67	EN2001d.C.spurt.132 Yeah	374.54	374.75	EN2001d.B.spurt.133 Yeah	374.97	375.37	EN2001d.D.spurt.135 I	376.65	377.46	EN2001d.C.spurt.136
D: Creating fires anyway like sort of for real files	1342.06	1344.83	EN2001e.B.spurt.263 Yeah	1366.5	1366.9	EN2001e.B.spurt.265 One problem with this is ageing in general is that	1367.7	1369.83	EN2001e.B.spurt.266 They hate you for doing anything on them	1373.71	1375.68	EN2001e.B.spurt.268
B: Or	300.25	300.85	EN2001b.B.spurt.118 I had um	305.43	306.63	EN2001b.A.spurt.119 a look at the	306.63	308.0	EN2001b.A.spurt.120 Um	308.94	309.65	EN2001b.A.spurt.121
C: I	377.36	378.53	EN2001d.A.spurt.137 Um	392.04	392.98	EN2001d.B.spurt.139 To get this button state	395.05	396.23	EN2001d.B.spurt.140 Yeah	396.84	397.32	EN2001d.D.spurt.141
D: Yeah	1411.56	1412.0	EN2001e.B.spurt.272 Yeah	1420.63	1421.3	EN2001e.B.spurt.273 "'cause" of all Primitive version of the sound	1421.3	1424.09	EN2001e.B.spurt.274 To have relatively soon would be good	1425.0	1426.97	EN2001e.B.spurt.275
B: for example at a. is	309.65	310.81	EN2001b.A.spurt.122 Not true Oh	309.93	311.51	EN2001b.B.spurt.123 Mm	311.46	311.96	EN2001b.C.spurt.124 So yeah so i was thinking	313.84	315.45	EN2001b.B.spurt.125
C: Yeah from	398.52	399.0	EN2001d.A.spurt.142 Probably all these what was and and um suspect differently in the Thing know what's the problem	400.08	406.21	EN2001d.A.spurt.144 Yeah	404.41	405.1	EN2001d.B.spurt.145 Should try to rely i	406.98	409.04	EN2001d.A.spurt.146
D: I think	1428.13	1428.59	EN2001e.B.spurt.276 Okay	1431.98	1432.52	EN2001e.B.spurt.277 Okay	1433.27	1433.88	EN2001e.B.spurt.278 Okay	1434.31	1434.76	EN2001e.B.spurt.279
B: And the	320.13	320.49	EN2001b.B.spurt.127 Um	321.92	322.3	EN2001b.B.spurt.128 San juan know and you could stand that stuff that is plastics and i'm sure	332.68	336.26	EN2001b.B.spurt.129 Take was about	336.66	337.44	EN2001b.A.spurt.130
C: Right	410.11	410.47	EN2001d.A.spurt.147 Okay	416.19	416.64	EN2001d.D.spurt.149 But that should be a small issue	416.96	418.27	EN2001d.B.spurt.150 I that's a very old one rather i i think those as the same ease and so on this thing is that it's uh because of the problem with my	417.8	426.12	EN2001d.A.spurt.151
D: Okay	1435.77	1436.37	EN2001e.B.spurt.280 Okay	1437.74	1438.18	EN2001e.B.spurt.281 Or less but not working better because not so much	1457.48	1459.85	EN2001e.B.spurt.286 More evenly distributed	1460.4	1461.67	EN2001e.B.spurt.287
B: Yeah but i'm afraid only five fox and firefox doesn't have a nest egg smell of urine more	338.33	342.09	EN2001b.B.spurt.131 I think i And i was uh	344.45	346.79	EN2001b.B.spurt.132 Mm	350.49	350.94	EN2001b.B.spurt.133 I was just in x. m.	354.3	355.72	EN2001b.B.spurt.134
C: Um	426.97	427.51	EN2001d.A.spurt.152 So we see that give a very different density curve as well for this one	432.07	434.86	EN2001d.B.spurt.155 That's the thing room	432.34	433.28	EN2001d.A.spurt.156 And	436.72	437.32	EN2001d.B.spurt.157
D: Where	1472.8	1473.24	EN2001e.B.spurt.288 Average off means square difference from the mean uh something which the problem with that is that generally first have to get the mean and only two only once you have to mean you know what	1497.33	1506.54	EN2001e.B.spurt.292 In one go	1509.14	1509.83	EN2001e.B.spurt.293 You have to write that	1510.36	1511.21	EN2001e.B.spurt.294
B: So what we have and when we um mixing our um	358.6	362.8	EN2001b.C.spurt.135 they're used together as that	362.8	364.04	EN2001b.C.spurt.136 Um the value for each um	364.63	367.59	EN2001b.C.spurt.137 expression for each sentence or something	367.59	369.82	EN2001b.C.spurt.138
C: Okay	445.63	445.77	EN2001d.C.spurt.159 So i'm i'm costly touching stuff on my screen or a less	447.22	449.65	EN2001d.B.spurt.160 And	450.1	450.77	EN2001d.B.spurt.161 What would you think so that if You know if if there's a certain degree	470.48	474.08	EN2001d.B.spurt.164
D: Yeah it's it's not the symbols but that like that's the most professional way i can think about it	1531.87	1535.66	EN2001e.B.spurt.297 That would indirectly also drop stuff i mean that would drop	1536.34	1538.92	EN2001e.B.spurt.298 Whatever is below or	1539.86	1540.8	EN2001e.B.spurt.299 Just requires you to have to mean initially	1551.14	1553.3	EN2001e.B.spurt.301
B: Yeah i think that would be in	370.46	371.82	EN2001b.A.spurt.139 Yeah	372.1	372.78	EN2001b.C.spurt.140 You know um	377.22	378.46	EN2001b.A.spurt.142 What scope one	379.08	380.67	EN2001b.A.spurt.143
C: Can i like um ontology if you would be that	488.43	490.55	EN2001d.B.spurt.169 Yeah	492.71	493.36	EN2001d.B.spurt.171 Otherwise you Going to slowly here	493.17	495.49	EN2001d.A.spurt.172 yeah well i guess that could be adapted	493.36	494.91	EN2001d.B.spurt.173
D: And that makes some things exactly twice as competition expensive And there is a way of doing it committed committed to fly	1554.03	1559.44	EN2001e.B.spurt.302 Hmm	1563.02	1563.47	EN2001e.B.spurt.303 So yeah so that's one possible way of doing that	1566.79	1570.22	EN2001e.B.spurt.304 So	1576.13	1576.44	EN2001e.B.spurt.305
B: Uh-huh	381.82	382.24	EN2001b.C.spurt.145 I think it would be certainly more than one worked	384.84	387.3	EN2001b.A.spurt.146 And	387.79	388.31	EN2001b.A.spurt.147 I think	389.68	390.08	EN2001b.A.spurt.148
C: Um	506.55	507.08	EN2001d.B.spurt.176 So that we should do is that the detect it you can space	516.66	519.77	EN2001d.B.spurt.179 I think that to be honest is something we can worry about	519.28	522.33	EN2001d.D.spurt.180 Yeah	527.01	527.59	EN2001d.B.spurt.182
D: That's just the loading state right	1583.74	1585.33	EN2001e.B.spurt.306 Uh-huh	1609.87	1610.03	EN2001e.A.spurt.311 No it that's my task that if a a change that just	1613.06	1615.27	EN2001e.B.spurt.312 So	1618.04	1618.49	EN2001e.B.spurt.313
B: Yeah	392.61	393.05	EN2001b.C.spurt.150 Yeah i would just end up with um values for each word So i wouldn't have	395.39	400.05	EN2001b.C.spurt.151 Um	400.42	400.88	EN2001b.C.spurt.152 Any	402.1	402.74	EN2001b.C.spurt.153
C: Okay	543.88	544.33	EN2001d.D.spurt.189 Changing result	550.62	551.46	EN2001d.D.spurt.193 Well point in that	560.66	561.56	EN2001d.D.spurt.198 Take a vitamin hash out of hmm	568.11	570.15	EN2001d.D.spurt.201

B: It just it just would have The words and then how we um	407.08	411.05	EN2001b.C.spurt.155 How long each expression would be i don't know	411.61	414.34	EN2001b.C.spurt.156 Well we each term safety	422.88	424.64	EN2001b.B.spurt.159 yeah	423.28	423.78	EN2001b.C.spurt.160
C: Sure we abandoned the whole notion of seeing the whole	573.2	576.16	EN2001d.B.spurt.204 Certainly for now yeah	579.03	580.36	EN2001d.D.spurt.206 Certainly for non probably for good that means something	580.39	582.86	EN2001d.B.spurt.207 Um	588.93	589.52	EN2001d.D.spurt.209
D: know	1632.75	1633.14	EN2001e.A.spurt.320 The interesting thing is that because structure of this It isn't enough to just say well if you don't have some pretty don't have sound at least i think that's what our um our problem was that	1638.77	1647.15	EN2001e.B.spurt.322 Yeah	1648.91	1649.51	EN2001e.B.spurt.323 not	1649.51	1649.74	EN2001e.B.spurt.324
B: Okay	425.84	426.47	EN2001b.C.spurt.162 Yeah	427.6	428.19	EN2001b.B.spurt.163 For examine that	427.89	428.61	EN2001b.A.spurt.164 Point six that	429.94	430.96	EN2001b.A.spurt.165
C: well from point of cost developing it does a remote much different	589.52	593.98	EN2001d.D.spurt.210 Um	596.98	597.21	EN2001d.C.spurt.213 Okay	604.3	604.74	EN2001d.B.spurt.215 Uh-huh	609.21	609.67	EN2001d.C.spurt.217
D: So	1650.85	1651.22	EN2001e.B.spurt.325 I've worked around that there is ways i think to get around it but the problem is	1651.81	1655.54	EN2001e.B.spurt.326 Uh-huh	1663.87	1664.07	EN2001e.A.spurt.329 Uh-huh	1672.36	1673.17	EN2001e.A.spurt.331
B: I think so	438.41	439.1	EN2001b.A.spurt.167 Okay	439.08	439.53	EN2001b.C.spurt.168 I do it's Probably stay need to um	443.99	446.22	EN2001b.A.spurt.169 yeah well they use of of the words	446.22	448.4	EN2001b.A.spurt.170
C: Compare it to others	609.41	610.72	EN2001d.B.spurt.218 Okay	619.67	620.18	EN2001d.B.spurt.220 A hot spot a notation for that	632.36	633.89	EN2001d.A.spurt.224 That's i mean that's nuts	635.07	636.31	EN2001d.A.spurt.225
D: Yeah that makes is really great difficult for us if you want to	1673.91	1677.28	EN2001e.A.spurt.332 Where	1678.3	1678.62	EN2001e.B.spurt.333 Computers with uh cares	1681.72	1683.23	EN2001e.A.spurt.335 Yeah sure i mean i i yeah	1689.79	1691.76	EN2001e.A.spurt.337
B: Um	448.97	449.58	EN2001b.A.spurt.171 perhaps for for um maybe keywords but uh	449.58	452.61	EN2001b.A.spurt.172 Mm	453.45	453.92	EN2001b.C.spurt.174 When you click on something	455.3	456.47	EN2001b.A.spurt.175
C: Um	643.65	644.19	EN2001d.D.spurt.228 Yeah but would you take it from	646.98	649.37	EN2001d.C.spurt.230 From my directory or okay	650.06	652.57	EN2001d.C.spurt.231 Yeah probably yeah best to make a copy of it	650.13	652.6	EN2001d.D.spurt.232
D: i i just care for the whitman does that work without the soundtracks	1691.76	1695.56	EN2001e.A.spurt.338 Yeah	1694.4	1694.83	EN2001e.B.spurt.339 Yeah so that	1695.22	1695.95	EN2001e.B.spurt.340 Okay	1696.09	1696.44	EN2001e.A.spurt.341
B: So i would have to fit in more than just one way to know you see mm	455.99	460.51	EN2001b.C.spurt.176 Uh-huh	459.27	459.63	EN2001b.D.spurt.177 Yeah but that's not a a presentation then i think	460.98	464.19	EN2001b.A.spurt.178 So	464.62	464.89	EN2001b.B.spurt.179
C: Wonderful	654.14	654.77	EN2001d.D.spurt.233 Well i think i'm gonna be able to be um the speech two or three	660.11	664.39	EN2001d.D.spurt.234 It's really bad	669.67	670.58	EN2001d.D.spurt.236 I've known think they're just really a square	671.02	672.99	EN2001d.D.spurt.237
D: Yeah	1696.35	1696.81	EN2001e.B.spurt.342 Yeah	1697.8	1698.24	EN2001e.B.spurt.343 Okay	1698.25	1698.72	EN2001e.A.spurt.345 yeah	1698.72	1699.06	EN2001e.A.spurt.346
B: For the importance matter	464.81	466.66	EN2001b.A.spurt.180 Yeah	465.56	466.0	EN2001b.C.spurt.181 Does anyone	467.55	468.2	EN2001b.B.spurt.182 But um	467.61	468.19	EN2001b.C.spurt.183
C: The	673.46	673.83	EN2001d.D.spurt.238 The system cool	674.32	675.22	EN2001d.D.spurt.239 Yeah	677.04	677.34	EN2001d.B.spurt.240 Yeah	679.68	680.1	EN2001d.B.spurt.241
D: Yeah but then that means that because contest it	1705.7	1708.09	EN2001e.B.spurt.347 That's the problem like	1708.65	1709.63	EN2001e.B.spurt.348 Yes but without that or you don't have	1714.07	1715.95	EN2001e.B.spurt.349 What i see right it doesn't like it doesn't strictly have to do any movement in it yeah	1717.17	1721.34	EN2001e.B.spurt.350
B: Um	474.87	475.26	EN2001b.A.spurt.186 Yes	476.81	477.32	EN2001b.A.spurt.187 No it's not then it was um	478.83	480.96	EN2001b.A.spurt.189 For some this could be d. b. o. or ones see point	481.39	485.52	EN2001b.A.spurt.190
C: Yeah yeah	681.66	682.3	EN2001d.D.spurt.242 No	684.75	685.23	EN2001d.B.spurt.244 So even if you sort of even if you do in our class of that well and and you know	698.06	702.0	EN2001d.B.spurt.249 I don't think it would take that long anyway	706.57	708.19	EN2001d.D.spurt.251
D: Yeah but we have to comment stuff on for that	1727.04	1728.68	EN2001e.B.spurt.351 That's what i'm saying that there is	1735.46	1736.81	EN2001e.B.spurt.353 We can make it a flat could be just make it a a like a run-time fly gonna make a few use and say if	1737.23	1742.3	EN2001e.B.spurt.354 Yes top	1747.27	1747.84	EN2001e.B.spurt.355
B: What does it and with that and with with sex	486.09	488.25	EN2001b.B.spurt.191 Is that look like it	489.93	490.83	EN2001b.B.spurt.192 Uh	492.45	492.97	EN2001b.A.spurt.193 i couldn't see anything that much but	492.97	494.89	EN2001b.A.spurt.194
C: Yeah	714.65	714.91	EN2001d.D.spurt.254 yeah	714.91	715.33	EN2001d.D.spurt.255 Yeah	719.56	720.15	EN2001d.B.spurt.257 Yeah	731.25	731.64	EN2001d.B.spurt.260
D: There is	1748.66	1749.2	EN2001e.B.spurt.356 Yeah	1753.89	1754.55	EN2001e.B.spurt.357 Yeah	1756.99	1757.51	EN2001e.B.spurt.358 so anyway so that's something we should probably do in one way or another because	1757.51	1761.61	EN2001e.B.spurt.359
B: Uh	494.45	494.77	EN2001b.C.spurt.195 Yeah	494.89	495.21	EN2001b.D.spurt.196 Uh	495.23	495.62	EN2001b.B.spurt.197 Yeah that's that's it	495.25	496.51	EN2001b.A.spurt.198
C: Mm like that handle seen in the output if you need some of that	739.05	741.52	EN2001d.B.spurt.262 Um an income need to	742.08	743.29	EN2001d.D.spurt.263 Okay	743.52	743.93	EN2001d.B.spurt.264 Okay	749.45	749.84	EN2001d.B.spurt.266
D: No nothing much to talk about this	1783.17	1785.68	EN2001e.B.spurt.362 So apart from like a a search box and the similarity thing	1786.3	1790.18	EN2001e.B.spurt.363 Once tactics	1790.78	1791.55	EN2001e.B.spurt.364 Rubber but	1792.42	1793.08	EN2001e.B.spurt.365
B: okay	495.62	496.29	EN2001b.B.spurt.199 I think that's a yeah	496.29	497.4	EN2001b.D.spurt.200 Yes	498.62	499.08	EN2001b.B.spurt.201 That's if you just see maybe cave right	501.13	503.22	EN2001b.B.spurt.203
C: Um	751.72	752.35	EN2001d.B.spurt.267 I really know what to talk about	753.76	755.47	EN2001d.B.spurt.268 We have	758.4	758.96	EN2001d.B.spurt.269 Hmm	759.35	759.99	EN2001d.B.spurt.270
D: Um	1793.48	1794.05	EN2001e.B.spurt.366 this is more less in the end like this is very similar to what a product look like in the end	1794.05	1798.2	EN2001e.B.spurt.367 Yeah	1813.34	1813.84	EN2001e.A.spurt.372 If we	1814.44	1815.37	EN2001e.A.spurt.373
B: So much and this and	506.1	507.6	EN2001b.B.spurt.204 In some hmm	508.25	509.52	EN2001b.B.spurt.205 Is that they're just so you can see why i see	514.03	516.55	EN2001b.B.spurt.206 That's right	519.78	520.25	EN2001b.C.spurt.207
C: Which you can work a lot more or less so that's good	769.5	772.19	EN2001d.B.spurt.272 Um	773.45	774.12	EN2001d.B.spurt.273 I think we should decide what we want it to actually look like in the end	774.91	778.66	EN2001d.D.spurt.274 Because if	792.27	793.13	EN2001d.D.spurt.278
D: You wanted to provide it um	1820.71	1822.93	EN2001e.A.spurt.375 Okay	1820.71	1821.11	EN2001e.B.spurt.376 yeah	1821.11	1821.45	EN2001e.B.spurt.377 that an extra just saying	1822.93	1825.42	EN2001e.A.spurt.378
B: Can be the front	520.48	521.97	EN2001b.A.spurt.208 Just see if we can mm	521.49	523.36	EN2001b.B.spurt.209 Okay	537.28	537.91	EN2001b.B.spurt.210 So	540.51	540.99	EN2001b.B.spurt.211
C: Um	804.56	805.1	EN2001d.B.spurt.282 Do you think it will i mean do you think like	819.56	820.99	EN2001d.B.spurt.285 I think it might why the costs and me um stiff	820.99	824.96	EN2001d.A.spurt.286 Like quite a lot of	825.69	826.97	EN2001d.A.spurt.287
D: Okay	1824.97	1825.52	EN2001e.B.spurt.379 Yeah for example yeah	1831.3	1832.53	EN2001e.A.spurt.382 Yeah we could just make	1832.71	1833.72	EN2001e.B.spurt.383 Not just yet but that should that set see that's pretty only thing i can say i can do this week because	1836.62	1841.15	EN2001e.B.spurt.384
B: Okay	541.46	541.9	EN2001b.A.spurt.212 so you know this for	541.9	543.54	EN2001b.A.spurt.213 This is this	544.16	545.3	EN2001b.B.spurt.214 anything i think in these	552.96	554.41	EN2001b.A.spurt.217
C: Um	827.48	828.03	EN2001d.A.spurt.288 Um	829.89	830.55	EN2001d.A.spurt.290 Um	842.33	842.71	EN2001d.A.spurt.293 To have a lot about that	843.14	844.2	EN2001d.A.spurt.294
D: I think before we should do is that	1848.39	1850.27	EN2001e.B.spurt.386 Something You want to monitor	1889.44	1891.18	EN2001e.B.spurt.394 If we can skip more accurately then	1901.01	1903.03	EN2001e.B.spurt.395 Yeah	1915.69	1916.35	EN2001e.B.spurt.396
B: Um	556.3	556.86	EN2001b.A.spurt.218 that's why it's	556.86	558.2	EN2001b.A.spurt.219 Yeah that's got different their files three speaker	565.97	568.45	EN2001b.D.spurt.221 What is this and this doesn't contain any content make any text	569.75	573.61	EN2001b.B.spurt.222
C: Where	849.39	849.68	EN2001d.B.spurt.297 Yeah	853.23	853.72	EN2001d.B.spurt.300 Yeah	867.49	867.97	EN2001d.B.spurt.303 Yeah that works	877.39	878.26	EN2001d.B.spurt.305
D: Hmm	1916.92	1917.8	EN2001e.B.spurt.397 I know why that is	1937.38	1938.77	EN2001e.A.spurt.399 That's probably "'cause" it's coming from my resolution and that's You've much high resolution so	1941.11	1945.9	EN2001e.B.spurt.400 Um	1949.04	1949.61	EN2001e.A.spurt.402
B: No but it	573.53	574.37	EN2001b.A.spurt.223 No i just points to uh	573.62	574.97	EN2001b.D.spurt.224 To the words	575.33	576.01	EN2001b.D.spurt.225 Uh when somebody system would explain it slowly to me	578.12	580.62	EN2001b.B.spurt.226
C: So the other than	877.86	878.9	EN2001d.D.spurt.306 Yeah of them would just great	879.27	880.94	EN2001d.D.spurt.307 I'll boundary between each one to see thing	881.76	884.9	EN2001d.D.spurt.308 Yes but apart from that we don't really Do anything different as bird watchers from you can	885.26	889.4	EN2001d.B.spurt.309
D: Ah okay	1950.36	1951.05	EN2001e.A.spurt.403 what you see here um	1951.05	1953.19	EN2001e.A.spurt.404 And this product	1953.73	1954.85	EN2001e.A.spurt.405 Is	1955.4	1955.95	EN2001e.A.spurt.406
B: So	581.06	581.75	EN2001b.B.spurt.227 Yeah it	583.36	583.8	EN2001b.A.spurt.228 I was some of them point to the words other i'll us point to the um	584.2	588.39	EN2001b.A.spurt.229 teletext	588.39	589.05	EN2001b.A.spurt.230
C: Yeah	887.92	888.39	EN2001d.D.spurt.310 i mean that's quite cheap way to do that	888.39	890.06	EN2001d.D.spurt.311 Yeah	890.22	890.68	EN2001d.B.spurt.312 Um	897.91	898.32	EN2001d.A.spurt.314
D: Uh	1956.32	1956.87	EN2001e.A.spurt.407 no models yeah that is yeah	1956.87	1958.39	EN2001e.A.spurt.408 Yeah it is um	1958.77	1960.65	EN2001e.A.spurt.409 uh this stuff V. and	1960.65	1963.18	EN2001e.A.spurt.410
B: Yeah	588.96	589.64	EN2001b.D.spurt.231 yeah	589.64	589.89	EN2001b.D.spurt.232 So that's kind of very noble thing that	589.95	593.43	EN2001b.A.spurt.233 Ties together	594.44	595.37	EN2001b.A.spurt.234
C: Um	909.68	910.56	EN2001d.B.spurt.318 I think that was P. land at the beginning was that	910.46	913.09	EN2001d.A.spurt.319 Yeah so that initially i thought it was was sort of more uh so it's functionality	913.6	917.26	EN2001d.B.spurt.320 Yeah	922.48	922.8	EN2001d.A.spurt.322
D: Um	1964.06	1964.78	EN2001e.A.spurt.411 boston part and r.	1964.78	1966.34	EN2001e.A.spurt.412 Um	1971.72	1972.32	EN2001e.A.spurt.414 So what are the number in the first brackets as	1973.14	1977.06	EN2001e.A.spurt.415
B: So what do all these things in this file as in common what what are they	595.26	598.54	EN2001b.B.spurt.235 Um	599.62	600.06	EN2001b.A.spurt.236 Yeah then if then i'd i. d.	601.47	603.17	EN2001b.A.spurt.237 Um by that	614.97	616.04	EN2001b.A.spurt.242
C: Okay	928.34	928.9	EN2001d.A.spurt.324 Um	941.71	942.18	EN2001d.A.spurt.328 no i i'm just going back to our initial idea of	942.18	945.28	EN2001d.A.spurt.329 No no i think that's	952.49	954.02	EN2001d.B.spurt.332
D: Um so have the number in the first brackets as how often that that to it in the	1984.86	1989.99	EN2001e.A.spurt.417 Um	1990.53	1991.09	EN2001e.A.spurt.418 By v.	1994.96	1995.56	EN2001e.A.spurt.420 Yeah	1996.02	1996.48	EN2001e.A.spurt.421
B: "'kay"	615.4	616.09	EN2001b.B.spurt.243 And	617.4	617.69	EN2001b.B.spurt.244 Yeah it looks uh	624.21	625.74	EN2001b.A.spurt.246 of the second thing looks in that into the words	625.74	628.89	EN2001b.A.spurt.247
C: I really don't wanna do that to be honest	954.86	956.54	EN2001d.B.spurt.333 Um	957.45	958.1	EN2001d.B.spurt.334 it would be nice but like this	958.1	959.45	EN2001d.B.spurt.335 And might be possible to do it in the summer a noise or	959.14	961.51	EN2001d.D.spurt.336
D: Um	1998.63	1999.22	EN2001e.A.spurt.423 and the number and the second per okay that's that's how much it occurred in the rest	1999.22	2004.24	EN2001e.A.spurt.424 And um the first number and every line is um	2004.89	2008.4	EN2001e.A.spurt.425 how much more often	2008.4	2009.97	EN2001e.A.spurt.426

D: One of these were that's this in there and	2065.28	2068.4	EN2001e.A.spurt.446 Simply add it up	2069.0	2069.96	EN2001e.A.spurt.447 So that should	2071.53	2072.59	EN2001e.A.spurt.448 Um	2077.73	2078.18	EN2001e.A.spurt.450
B: Hmm	701.91	702.61	EN2001b.B.spurt.270 And she's i'm trying to arrange some sort of you have	711.5	713.65	EN2001b.B.spurt.271 One above the other side to make some sense	714.44	716.19	EN2001b.B.spurt.272 So uh no he we had	728.21	729.89	EN2001b.B.spurt.273

D: and	2078.18	2078.48	EN2001e.A.spurt.451 Yeah and so these numbers yeah	2079.36	2081.31	EN2001e.A.spurt.452 um	2081.31	2081.76	EN2001e.A.spurt.453 one or a zero This year And that's	2081.76	2084.96	EN2001e.A.spurt.454
B: One tying on the others to the other	736.25	737.95	EN2001b.A.spurt.275 I think	746.53	747.04	EN2001b.A.spurt.277 Like it's it's referencing here this referencing to	752.45	755.93	EN2001b.B.spurt.279 To a certain position in there	758.85	760.8	EN2001b.B.spurt.280
C: Yeah and that It's a good cry if a little With it should be quite decent speaker names	1123.55	1128.8	EN2001d.D.spurt.394 Just rentals	1129.19	1129.96	EN2001d.B.spurt.397 I i have that side	1129.42	1130.98	EN2001d.A.spurt.398 That's that down	1129.69	1130.45	EN2001d.D.spurt.399

B: Yeah	763.6	764.06	EN2001b.D.spurt.282 i think so	764.06	764.54	EN2001b.D.spurt.283 So is that normal clothes on one here that's the mike norris okay	768.38	772.78	EN2001b.B.spurt.284 A sequence right	781.93	782.91	EN2001b.B.spurt.286
C: Okay	1130.99	1131.43	EN2001d.D.spurt.400 So	1131.52	1131.84	EN2001d.A.spurt.402 Just	1132.51	1132.97	EN2001d.A.spurt.403 Where is it is in the great	1133.18	1134.46	EN2001d.D.spurt.404

B: It's	783.52	783.86	EN2001b.A.spurt.287 So that's from w. fifty two	784.22	787.21	EN2001b.B.spurt.288 Yeah	792.07	792.48	EN2001b.A.spurt.290 yeah yeah	792.48	792.86	EN2001b.A.spurt.291
C: Yeah so um	1143.05	1143.9	EN2001d.D.spurt.407 So you should be only use that	1148.2	1149.58	EN2001d.D.spurt.410 It's uh quite easily	1150.5	1151.72	EN2001d.D.spurt.412 So what about	1155.95	1158.16	EN2001d.B.spurt.414

B: And uh	796.58	796.95	EN2001b.B.spurt.292 And to Discourse marker This is mark of that point five	798.94	803.71	EN2001b.A.spurt.293 Yeah that's	805.41	806.19	EN2001b.A.spurt.294 Yeah that's right know about	805.73	807.74	EN2001b.C.spurt.295
C: Just "'cause" that was low priority	1170.8	1172.45	EN2001d.D.spurt.419 I mean we can	1196.18	1196.73	EN2001d.B.spurt.429 A good question	1199.56	1200.44	EN2001d.B.spurt.430 Um	1201.1	1201.86	EN2001d.B.spurt.431

D: Um	2128.92	2129.38	EN2001e.A.spurt.474 Yeah that	2132.55	2133.1	EN2001e.A.spurt.476 Again	2134.29	2134.74	EN2001e.B.spurt.477 And signals	2134.4	2135.48	EN2001e.A.spurt.478

D: I think that's probably good part if we had a slide um	2135.84	2138.83	EN2001e.B.spurt.479 Dynamically at that the threshold of what we	2141.39	2144.0	EN2001e.B.spurt.481 Um because	2155.84	2156.49	EN2001e.B.spurt.483 Uh-huh	2163.71	2163.98	EN2001e.A.spurt.485

D: If i if i	2214.69	2217.26	EN2001e.A.spurt.512 I	2219.6	2219.99	EN2001e.A.spurt.513 Oh a few for	2220.5	2221.58	EN2001e.B.spurt.514 And that those um	2221.96	2223.35	EN2001e.A.spurt.515
B: Probably be in the sense that and	908.83	910.71	EN2001b.A.spurt.336 I guess you could introduce to do friend um	911.04	914.07	EN2001b.B.spurt.337 But if you have several a us then	913.43	915.99	EN2001b.A.spurt.338 We have for now if we just to something which for every	921.37	924.15	EN2001b.B.spurt.340
C: And i would have to look and i couldn't see what she does	1316.65	1319.4	EN2001d.D.spurt.483 They see is really bizarre it	1320.73	1322.29	EN2001d.D.spurt.484 Slows it down	1322.91	1323.79	EN2001d.D.spurt.485 The speed up something to what	1324.2	1325.59	EN2001d.D.spurt.486
D: Yeah i mean i think perhaps that's why we have back to write it so how yeah	2235.96	2240.26	EN2001e.A.spurt.519 Well i think i think that yeah	2245.8	2247.93	EN2001e.A.spurt.520 Yeah	2247.99	2248.42	EN2001e.B.spurt.521 I think it's also rated higher and uh	2248.51	2251.14	EN2001e.A.spurt.522
B: One number for now	935.37	937.01	EN2001b.B.spurt.342 Yeah i guess to do	941.37	942.27	EN2001b.B.spurt.344 Yeah so wouldn't did i mean the problem is They've me haven't looked at t. tech unit workings of yeah	948.97	954.95	EN2001b.B.spurt.347 A pension yet but You'd think that the easiest way and the way that how it's intended to be would be just	955.44	960.95	EN2001b.B.spurt.348
C: Well yeah it should be minus to utah and it should be off	1333.43	1336.14	EN2001d.D.spurt.490 I should do you beep week um parts in a while	1351.4	1353.9	EN2001d.D.spurt.496 Yeah	1354.7	1355.13	EN2001d.B.spurt.497 right yes	1355.13	1355.64	EN2001d.B.spurt.498
D: If anything's	2254.89	2255.59	EN2001e.A.spurt.524 Um	2259.48	2260.06	EN2001e.A.spurt.525 Yes yeah that's exactly what i'm getting yeah	2260.4	2263.42	EN2001e.A.spurt.526 Yeah it's just i mean it's it's exactly this Thing but just	2265.66	2270.11	EN2001e.A.spurt.527
B: Value which is	971.32	972.25	EN2001b.B.spurt.351 The number	972.71	973.37	EN2001b.B.spurt.352 Yeah	977.72	978.19	EN2001b.B.spurt.354 Yeah	978.16	978.58	EN2001b.C.spurt.355
C: It's messed up	1363.66	1364.59	EN2001d.C.spurt.500 I don't know i think it's just them	1365.56	1367.55	EN2001d.D.spurt.501 Yeah	1374.79	1375.42	EN2001d.B.spurt.503 yeah hmmm	1375.42	1376.09	EN2001d.B.spurt.504
D: And i mean this is that then look at them that so	2274.8	2277.31	EN2001e.A.spurt.529 Yeah i can just give it to you in the format you want So are are just	2281.98	2286.38	EN2001e.A.spurt.530 And then the score yeah this was just for showing it's	2288.62	2291.39	EN2001e.A.spurt.531 If the corresponding for each thing yeah they should be right	2295.48	2298.12	EN2001e.B.spurt.532
B: yeah	978.19	978.6	EN2001b.B.spurt.356 Yeah that's what you mean that yeah	978.76	980.42	EN2001b.A.spurt.357 Yeah	980.79	981.08	EN2001b.B.spurt.358 uh sorry i i thought you were talk about having two files	981.08	983.4	EN2001b.B.spurt.359
C: Okay yeah	1382.47	1383.2	EN2001d.D.spurt.507 Yeah that one of the	1384.93	1386.24	EN2001d.D.spurt.510 Past things into and then check when they got kicked really	1388.39	1391.01	EN2001d.B.spurt.511 So i mean it might be quite cool was if you could to um	1392.19	1394.57	EN2001d.D.spurt.512
D: Yeah	2302.24	2302.56	EN2001e.A.spurt.534 No	2305.11	2305.34	EN2001e.B.spurt.535 Okay	2305.59	2306.12	EN2001e.A.spurt.536 Oh okay	2316.74	2317.36	EN2001e.B.spurt.537
B: I was thinking yeah i think yeah um so do i thought you were want "'em" to have to do for next no fights The one the reference and one just just a number i was thinking	985.48	993.89	EN2001b.B.spurt.360 That story what you mean just um	994.59	996.18	EN2001b.B.spurt.361 Having "'kay"	996.99	997.62	EN2001b.B.spurt.362 There's any trouble with that repeating	1039.25	1041.22	EN2001b.B.spurt.372
C: You know some applications when you open for a week a little preview	1396.06	1399.77	EN2001d.D.spurt.513 He about died in the fall Something like that	1405.62	1408.14	EN2001d.D.spurt.515 Yeah	1413.23	1413.57	EN2001d.D.spurt.517 We couldn't the summer i know that we were over it yeah	1413.46	1416.21	EN2001d.B.spurt.518
D: yeah the one we can	2317.36	2318.52	EN2001e.B.spurt.538 Yeah	2322.02	2322.47	EN2001e.B.spurt.539 Yeah	2323.8	2324.29	EN2001e.B.spurt.540 Yeah	2324.93	2325.31	EN2001e.B.spurt.541
B: Um	1042.57	1043.12	EN2001b.A.spurt.373 Yeah i don't know that's probably not very uh	1049.89	1052.68	EN2001b.C.spurt.376 Nice but	1053.14	1053.71	EN2001b.C.spurt.377 Yeah i reckon actually for make a copy of it	1056.43	1058.49	EN2001b.B.spurt.379
C: The summers is quite quick to point it dynamically	1415.67	1418.34	EN2001d.D.spurt.519 Yeah	1420.53	1420.89	EN2001d.D.spurt.521 yeah the christian	1420.89	1421.95	EN2001d.D.spurt.522 but only for drawings that	1426.44	1427.95	EN2001d.D.spurt.524
D: You know what if you can	2325.91	2327.28	EN2001e.B.spurt.542 One	2338.59	2339.17	EN2001e.B.spurt.544 Thing around with it you know dunno what i mean	2342.67	2344.73	EN2001e.B.spurt.546 Um one problem I as they have this was all they yes because i mean	2353.99	2359.33	EN2001e.A.spurt.549
B: Yeah	1058.81	1059.12	EN2001b.C.spurt.381 Um	1067.36	1067.79	EN2001b.A.spurt.382 Plastic	1075.02	1075.5	EN2001b.A.spurt.384 not from	1078.55	1079.18	EN2001b.A.spurt.386
C: In a in a sense i mean if we	1427.35	1428.95	EN2001d.B.spurt.525 It's yeah	1429.65	1430.01	EN2001d.B.spurt.526 yeah	1430.01	1430.46	EN2001d.B.spurt.527 Would be really worthwhile	1444.26	1445.46	EN2001d.B.spurt.531
D: Obviously they're already at the same so	2359.99	2363.01	EN2001e.A.spurt.550 Um	2363.43	2364.05	EN2001e.A.spurt.551 and i was thinking that that looking um at the um	2364.05	2369.01	EN2001e.A.spurt.552 acoustic i was i have so for example at my f. c. oh	2369.01	2372.35	EN2001e.A.spurt.553
B: Make our fire one of those lazy do it but	1080.13	1083.3	EN2001b.A.spurt.387 I mean if no way idea whether it works	1083.96	1086.13	EN2001b.A.spurt.388 Yeah but	1092.16	1092.56	EN2001b.A.spurt.390 Yes but it has um	1093.37	1094.87	EN2001b.A.spurt.391
C: Well the quite good thing might be um	1459.74	1462.11	EN2001d.D.spurt.536 And job of never done it for	1465.68	1467.14	EN2001d.D.spurt.538 To apply what	1466.97	1467.67	EN2001d.B.spurt.540 If you give it Each one the tool to it had	1471.55	1474.18	EN2001d.D.spurt.542
D: Mm	2371.07	2371.42	EN2001e.B.spurt.554 Um	2372.75	2373.21	EN2001e.A.spurt.555 But um	2375.49	2376.74	EN2001e.A.spurt.557 yeah	2376.74	2377.19	EN2001e.A.spurt.558
B: Thing that it'll to think	1096.59	1097.88	EN2001b.A.spurt.393 I can't you can't	1102.64	1103.84	EN2001b.A.spurt.395 I think it	1108.18	1108.61	EN2001b.B.spurt.397 And it every	1108.27	1109.23	EN2001b.A.spurt.398
C: So that when you hold it over	1479.27	1480.57	EN2001d.D.spurt.545 Or alternatively you can always have	1482.0	1484.16	EN2001d.B.spurt.546 They yeah if we can get to to to we should use uh	1494.75	1497.39	EN2001d.D.spurt.549 Yeah that's what we've all	1504.53	1505.54	EN2001d.D.spurt.553
D: Um	2380.81	2381.39	EN2001e.A.spurt.560 And actually the	2382.38	2384.01	EN2001e.A.spurt.561 Average	2384.6	2385.39	EN2001e.A.spurt.562 For the positive ones then for the negative ones i mean there's a	2390.51	2394.25	EN2001e.A.spurt.564
B: I think so	1112.4	1112.88	EN2001b.A.spurt.400 That's a lie on a standard	1114.4	1115.49	EN2001b.A.spurt.401 So	1124.6	1125.21	EN2001b.A.spurt.404 User interface well uh the word site um	1142.11	1145.15	EN2001b.C.spurt.410
C: Um was quite common in like some application	1511.93	1514.9	EN2001d.D.spurt.555 Really have so far as intruders few words and	1514.96	1518.03	EN2001d.B.spurt.556 But yeah	1518.62	1519.17	EN2001d.B.spurt.557 Um	1529.35	1529.85	EN2001d.A.spurt.559
D: Different spots	2394.73	2395.63	EN2001e.A.spurt.565 It's probably not	2396.34	2397.57	EN2001e.A.spurt.566 Significant enough to really make use of it	2398.05	2400.53	EN2001e.A.spurt.567 But i	2401.14	2401.75	EN2001e.A.spurt.568
B: The solar	1147.52	1147.97	EN2001b.A.spurt.412 So so they have	1147.56	1148.78	EN2001b.C.spurt.413 So that's they um	1153.74	1155.44	EN2001b.C.spurt.415 Um	1180.83	1181.33	EN2001b.B.spurt.419
C: That's also according to they	1533.21	1534.91	EN2001d.A.spurt.561 Um	1544.14	1544.7	EN2001d.B.spurt.565 Does take you see like it takes	1551.66	1553.32	EN2001d.B.spurt.567 Um	1561.32	1562.0	EN2001d.B.spurt.569
D: I would also say	2402.49	2403.2	EN2001e.B.spurt.569 Let's investigate same	2402.78	2404.27	EN2001e.A.spurt.570 I would also	2406.18	2406.74	EN2001e.B.spurt.572 Yeah	2413.17	2413.66	EN2001e.A.spurt.573
B: which is like with a with a value	1181.33	1183.08	EN2001b.B.spurt.420 With that density value	1183.8	1185.26	EN2001b.B.spurt.421 Yeah	1187.48	1187.97	EN2001b.A.spurt.422 and i mean	1187.97	1188.8	EN2001b.A.spurt.423
C: Um	1582.9	1583.37	EN2001d.D.spurt.574 In the area could be smaller	1584.24	1585.69	EN2001d.C.spurt.575 Yeah	1591.05	1591.35	EN2001d.B.spurt.578 That's fine	1600.5	1600.98	EN2001d.D.spurt.581
D: so and i it's my my head off of this was that	2413.66	2416.87	EN2001e.A.spurt.574 And if	2421.86	2422.24	EN2001e.A.spurt.576 Line and if it is just the back to uh	2423.31	2425.42	EN2001e.A.spurt.577 But that has nothing to do with a special	2432.32	2434.56	EN2001e.A.spurt.579
B: Problem	1196.03	1196.44	EN2001b.A.spurt.426 Um	1211.17	1211.67	EN2001b.A.spurt.431 yeah i i don't know how	1211.67	1213.15	EN2001b.A.spurt.432 About you would feel worse but um	1213.67	1216.27	EN2001b.A.spurt.433
C: The commands for like really just redrawing small	1602.96	1606.05	EN2001d.B.spurt.582 The current position bar would be	1612.72	1614.46	EN2001d.B.spurt.584 But you should be in in	1623.41	1624.69	EN2001d.B.spurt.586 So	1633.6	1634.28	EN2001d.B.spurt.587
D: No but like	2435.72	2436.21	EN2001e.B.spurt.580 Because yeah so you have um	2435.77	2437.88	EN2001e.A.spurt.581 you don't have it on your with the yes you have it also with words that are Much higher end	2437.88	2442.84	EN2001e.A.spurt.582 Yes the same problem like for example uh with	2443.39	2445.98	EN2001e.A.spurt.583
B: Mm	1220.92	1221.39	EN2001b.B.spurt.436 I uh i would just have to	1230.06	1231.53	EN2001b.A.spurt.438 Yeah that's	1237.93	1238.7	EN2001b.A.spurt.442 Okay	1240.74	1241.31	EN2001b.B.spurt.443
C: The the general concept we we you to just keep on working	1635.37	1639.23	EN2001d.B.spurt.588 And we we looking for something else to do or	1649.17	1651.56	EN2001d.B.spurt.591 I can try to finish missed that	1661.6	1663.87	EN2001d.A.spurt.593 Um only That's um	1665.24	1667.71	EN2001d.A.spurt.594
D: Yep that's much high ranked	2446.38	2448.06	EN2001e.A.spurt.584 Because that are close	2448.58	2449.93	EN2001e.A.spurt.585 Yes often	2450.73	2451.61	EN2001e.A.spurt.586 Um in the training thing	2452.3	2454.22	EN2001e.A.spurt.587
B: And computer of	1247.81	1248.69	EN2001b.B.spurt.445 Info about	1251.03	1251.77	EN2001b.B.spurt.446 Just for each of those	1252.3	1253.79	EN2001b.B.spurt.447 um power so um pas so sometimes	1265.92	1268.31	EN2001b.A.spurt.450
C: Otherwise i can	1668.68	1669.95	EN2001d.A.spurt.595 Stay keep working on it	1671.59	1672.81	EN2001d.A.spurt.596 Proving it i think	1673.41	1674.33	EN2001d.A.spurt.597 No right now i don't think that much uh	1683.12	1685.31	EN2001d.D.spurt.599

B: It it depends on the position	1332.53	1334.26	EN2001b.B.spurt.469 Yeah	1333.32	1333.78	EN2001b.C.spurt.470 Hmm	1336.78	1337.41	EN2001b.B.spurt.471 And you doing this why uh some software that's like external software so you can't	1340.07	1343.92	EN2001b.B.spurt.472
C: yeah you switch you know that it's okay	1716.83	1718.73	EN2001d.C.spurt.617 Well i guess i mean	1719.88	1720.78	EN2001d.B.spurt.619 Mm	1726.13	1726.69	EN2001d.C.spurt.622 Huh	1726.6	1727.07	EN2001d.B.spurt.624

B: Yeah i i could	1344.07	1345.05	EN2001b.C.spurt.473 Use another a different approach the remote	1345.49	1348.22	EN2001b.C.spurt.474 Which then	1353.82	1354.5	EN2001b.B.spurt.476 Yeah	1357.94	1358.44	EN2001b.C.spurt.478

D: Again i'd say probably a good way of going about the question is to have Control which we can vary in that is	2586.66	2593.38	EN2001e.B.spurt.619 Could just	2587.03	2587.6	EN2001e.A.spurt.620 Um	2610.22	2610.79	EN2001e.B.spurt.623 Uh-huh	2611.19	2611.72	EN2001e.A.spurt.624
B: Mm	1362.82	1363.19	EN2001b.D.spurt.480 The problem is the next night except we provide a lot of the tools that we need to do that	1366.89	1371.07	EN2001b.B.spurt.481 Mm	1371.19	1371.58	EN2001b.C.spurt.483 In in a temporal sequence	1380.47	1382.02	EN2001b.B.spurt.484
C: Yeah	1753.33	1753.72	EN2001d.D.spurt.634 Which are really like the percentage score so that would be good	1757.15	1759.69	EN2001d.B.spurt.635 Sixteen	1764.05	1764.92	EN2001d.B.spurt.637 yeah	1764.29	1764.84	EN2001d.D.spurt.638

C: Uh-huh	2038.3	2038.82	EN2001d.B.spurt.753 If i just take one file all	2038.51	2041.51	EN2001d.C.spurt.754 Concatenate all those	2045.29	2046.6	EN2001d.C.spurt.756 Should be too	2047.17	2047.95	EN2001d.C.spurt.757
D: Yeah	3051.72	3052.11	EN2001e.B.spurt.721 We then need some way of getting back up again the hierarchy but that	3053.1	3056.22	EN2001e.B.spurt.722 Needs	3069.34	3070.04	EN2001e.B.spurt.724 That thing to work The one	3070.44	3072.41	EN2001e.B.spurt.725
B: there are several documents for	1630.55	1632.67	EN2001b.C.spurt.589 Um	1634.73	1635.33	EN2001b.C.spurt.590 Yeah but	1637.73	1638.11	EN2001b.B.spurt.592 Okay	1646.92	1647.46	EN2001b.B.spurt.595
C: Yeah	2056.37	2056.67	EN2001d.B.spurt.759 Where do you think you can do something like that okay	2057.94	2060.7	EN2001d.B.spurt.760 I think we should go for like for one group not for the whole corpus	2062.1	2065.45	EN2001d.B.spurt.761 Now and then	2079.63	2080.31	EN2001d.B.spurt.764
D: I know that's work at home anyway the one that i just say give me one hundred well you so what i think that then you're entirely	3073.59	3079.34	EN2001e.B.spurt.726 A million different second no no but it doesn't have to	3086.14	3089.22	EN2001e.B.spurt.728 Even know it doesn't have to	3089.75	3090.81	EN2001e.B.spurt.729 Okay but that's all details um	3091.49	3093.17	EN2001e.B.spurt.730
B: okay	1647.46	1647.74	EN2001b.B.spurt.596 okay	1647.74	1648.11	EN2001b.B.spurt.597 Couches think that does make sense nobody if you if that's just while you're waiting	1648.96	1652.54	EN2001b.B.spurt.598 Okay	1653.33	1654.05	EN2001b.B.spurt.599
C: So so you want um	2079.64	2081.51	EN2001d.A.spurt.765 the uday like like numbers to be	2081.51	2083.7	EN2001d.A.spurt.766 Um	2084.17	2084.74	EN2001d.A.spurt.767 Yeah	2085.45	2085.86	EN2001d.B.spurt.769
D: They can you just	3095.46	3096.64	EN2001e.B.spurt.731 Two and this would we have right now in	3097.3	3099.28	EN2001e.B.spurt.732 Yeah	3110.52	3111.03	EN2001e.B.spurt.733 And if and	3118.85	3119.3	EN2001e.B.spurt.734
B: Have yeah but like Looked into different ways of fact i was i was just think that i mean there For some of the uh	1655.08	1660.3	EN2001b.B.spurt.600 Yeah	1667.78	1668.41	EN2001b.C.spurt.602 And	1669.83	1670.26	EN2001b.B.spurt.604 I can just like	1689.0	1689.66	EN2001b.B.spurt.607
C: Yeah	2086.95	2087.32	EN2001d.D.spurt.770 Yeah no but they've um	2090.04	2091.51	EN2001d.B.spurt.771 A unique in on that right entire corpus	2104.22	2106.6	EN2001d.D.spurt.774 Uh-huh	2107.61	2108.16	EN2001d.B.spurt.775
D: Um	3130.68	3131.22	EN2001e.B.spurt.736 Hmm	3131.19	3131.62	EN2001e.A.spurt.737 Is how to do two chips	3136.6	3138.39	EN2001e.B.spurt.739 The type of a mouse over this line here and then it would tell me something or what it is That would be quite convenient for lot of things because then you can sort of have	3152.02	3158.46	EN2001e.B.spurt.741
B: I can sit together that you've for twenty minutes and just	1690.35	1693.07	EN2001b.B.spurt.608 Alright	1695.94	1696.29	EN2001b.C.spurt.610 It's probably uh we should work together "'cause" it's	1696.46	1698.94	EN2001b.B.spurt.611 We used we have t. b. to use the same matrix is i'm using a militant to make analysis you'd use to that that into its course	1699.75	1705.26	EN2001b.B.spurt.612
C: It's just got them	2111.57	2112.78	EN2001d.D.spurt.777 You need to be numbered for our entire corpus	2113.25	2115.53	EN2001d.D.spurt.778 Okay	2119.79	2120.27	EN2001d.B.spurt.780 and and that's the	2120.27	2121.27	EN2001d.B.spurt.781
D: Uh-huh	3161.36	3161.86	EN2001e.A.spurt.743 yes	3161.86	3162.39	EN2001e.A.spurt.744 So that one is ever border if they want to use they can do that	3167.27	3170.27	EN2001e.B.spurt.745 Yes but	3181.91	3182.91	EN2001e.B.spurt.746
B: Uh-huh	1703.54	1703.99	EN2001b.C.spurt.613 And then we'd have um	1705.94	1707.49	EN2001b.B.spurt.614 Uh-huh	1714.6	1715.18	EN2001b.C.spurt.617 The fact that there's one work has about what would be the next word	1723.47	1726.32	EN2001b.B.spurt.619
C: And it makes more sense to do that anyway because um	2121.09	2123.95	EN2001d.D.spurt.782 Could we	2143.94	2144.62	EN2001d.A.spurt.786 Could be just um	2146.64	2147.78	EN2001d.A.spurt.787 take the um	2147.78	2148.97	EN2001d.A.spurt.788
D: So anyway i haven't looked much into that so if	3202.58	3204.38	EN2001e.B.spurt.748 Yeah	3215.17	3215.61	EN2001e.B.spurt.750 And you could sampled that	3229.37	3230.64	EN2001e.B.spurt.753 Anyway yes that is that it for now	3233.33	3235.32	EN2001e.B.spurt.754
B: Um	1737.31	1737.9	EN2001b.B.spurt.622 Okay	1740.96	1741.43	EN2001b.C.spurt.624 So how	1742.05	1742.84	EN2001b.A.spurt.625 Sure i'm sure you are but the	1743.3	1745.28	EN2001b.A.spurt.626
C: And name each um	2149.51	2151.51	EN2001d.A.spurt.789 Dots	2154.92	2155.47	EN2001d.A.spurt.791 And that okay number would be a lot on the name but	2155.98	2159.27	EN2001d.A.spurt.792 It's possible but it's	2157.07	2158.38	EN2001d.D.spurt.793
D: Yeah	3250.03	3250.38	EN2001e.B.spurt.756 Yeah and i think like i just i just take in	3275.57	3277.95	EN2001e.B.spurt.760 Of the corporate model in which i think that she's doing	3284.13	3286.5	EN2001e.B.spurt.762 Five hours three hours	3286.93	3288.52	EN2001e.B.spurt.763
B: Yes yes it is i mean i think the official list of different description of what it tells you is um	1747.85	1753.41	EN2001b.B.spurt.628 How much that like the fact that a given go to curse does it but what's the next word gonna be	1753.85	1758.73	EN2001b.B.spurt.629 Which doesn't sound too exciting but it it just works out in the way that works which are promiscuous a number which are covered everything all over the place	1759.19	1765.72	EN2001b.B.spurt.630 Very low at its course and that's	1766.23	1767.62	EN2001b.B.spurt.631
C: Where's that	2169.53	2169.99	EN2001d.B.spurt.796 Quite nice	2169.73	2170.44	EN2001d.D.spurt.797 Maybe maybe we talking like so	2170.6	2172.74	EN2001d.B.spurt.798 Well you could you could choose what have you want to	2180.4	2182.83	EN2001d.D.spurt.800
D: You take a look at that	3289.59	3290.45	EN2001e.B.spurt.764 Yeah but	3291.37	3292.0	EN2001e.A.spurt.765 Not too d. k. so	3292.41	3293.7	EN2001e.A.spurt.766 Okay	3301.86	3302.47	EN2001e.B.spurt.768
B: And also usually end up being the words which are	1768.45	1771.25	EN2001b.B.spurt.632 Like function words and stuff	1776.52	1777.88	EN2001b.D.spurt.634 Yeah	1777.89	1778.12	EN2001b.B.spurt.635 But at least uh sensible	1790.5	1791.86	EN2001b.A.spurt.638
C: Thing rather than	2198.54	2199.54	EN2001d.B.spurt.804 But	2214.89	2215.13	EN2001d.B.spurt.807 By hand than sitting in star in four point	2221.94	2224.29	EN2001d.D.spurt.810 Yeah but that's a decision we have forcing on the user when we don't have to	2251.22	2254.78	EN2001d.D.spurt.814
D: Oh	3306.1	3306.19	EN2001e.B.spurt.769 Really	3324.63	3325.04	EN2001e.B.spurt.770 Okay	3327.0	3327.43	EN2001e.B.spurt.771 Hmm	3334.76	3335.38	EN2001e.A.spurt.772
B: Things because i mean they they What's really really looking for appear not too often and if they appear	1792.56	1800.3	EN2001b.A.spurt.639 Yeah so we we we wouldn't do it by word you would	1806.24	1808.73	EN2001b.B.spurt.641 Sorry okay and i was i was getting that actually sorry i was getting the trauma was getting it from what i did my project and this case We would do it by	1809.74	1817.75	EN2001b.B.spurt.642 So	1821.8	1822.7	EN2001b.B.spurt.644
C: You want to stay to that shouldn't	2251.28	2252.78	EN2001d.B.spurt.815 Okay	2255.19	2255.64	EN2001d.B.spurt.816 Yeah	2274.45	2275.09	EN2001d.D.spurt.821 i don't see why not	2275.09	2275.89	EN2001d.D.spurt.822
D: No maybe he has mentioned to them but they just never or something we didn't talk to them so	3338.33	3342.37	EN2001e.B.spurt.773 Hmm	3354.94	3355.6	EN2001e.A.spurt.776 I	3356.42	3356.99	EN2001e.A.spurt.777 But that	3362.1	3362.56	EN2001e.B.spurt.778
B: Yeah but that's a set a a list i think similar to what i'm doing because words that are in every class that now	1823.35	1830.94	EN2001b.C.spurt.645 I don't understand that	1823.54	1824.71	EN2001b.A.spurt.646 Mm	1831.2	1831.53	EN2001b.B.spurt.647 Yes it is probably doing is bridging quite the same thing in the end um just saying like	1837.69	1841.67	EN2001b.B.spurt.649
C: Okay well if that's possible yeah	2276.62	2277.99	EN2001d.B.spurt.823 Oh okay i thought you had panel on	2286.39	2288.61	EN2001d.C.spurt.828 Uh-huh	2295.1	2295.44	EN2001d.C.spurt.833 Yeah	2296.75	2297.13	EN2001d.D.spurt.835

C: Okay	2440.5	2441.01	EN2001d.A.spurt.883 For us	2440.51	2441.14	EN2001d.B.spurt.884 Might be interesting	2442.62	2443.59	EN2001d.C.spurt.885 Mm maybe	2447.54	2448.24	EN2001d.C.spurt.887
D: Uh-huh	3664.2	3664.77	EN2001e.B.spurt.841 Yeah and that's gonna be something	3679.53	3681.27	EN2001e.B.spurt.843 Well actually they they they they today	3714.49	3716.74	EN2001e.B.spurt.844 Yeah	3774.99	3775.78	EN2001e.B.spurt.852

C: Yeah	2448.14	2448.55	EN2001d.A.spurt.888 but then the user would have to know board what	2448.55	2451.26	EN2001d.A.spurt.889 Yeah	2451.14	2451.97	EN2001d.B.spurt.890 yeah i think we	2451.97	2452.61	EN2001d.B.spurt.891
D: so	3775.78	3776.15	EN2001e.B.spurt.853 Which is core	3783.12	3784.35	EN2001e.B.spurt.855 Anyway the space something useful for that	3787.11	3789.01	EN2001e.B.spurt.856 Something from source for that that's it	3789.73	3791.61	EN2001e.B.spurt.857
B: Or what scroll what do i get that just though "'cause" once in all the corpus for example	1996.37	2001.78	EN2001b.A.spurt.711 Even though there are only about the same topic so it doesn't require	2005.98	2010.41	EN2001b.A.spurt.713 Yeah	2011.23	2011.52	EN2001b.B.spurt.714 "'cause" this would	2012.15	2012.68	EN2001b.B.spurt.715
C: Was what um	2452.32	2453.76	EN2001d.A.spurt.892 what contributed to them loose screw up somewhat country to read ones	2453.76	2458.17	EN2001d.A.spurt.893 We shouldn't	2453.91	2454.38	EN2001d.B.spurt.894 We should assume and	2456.97	2458.0	EN2001d.B.spurt.895
D: It's	3814.92	3815.4	EN2001e.B.spurt.859 Mm	3823.49	3823.83	EN2001e.B.spurt.860 Hmm	3840.73	3841.1	EN2001e.B.spurt.863 Hmm	3847.02	3847.53	EN2001e.A.spurt.865
B: Uh-huh	2020.47	2020.82	EN2001b.A.spurt.717 Matter of sort of just going by	2020.8	2022.41	EN2001b.B.spurt.718 Um	2028.49	2028.97	EN2001b.A.spurt.720 our prayers	2028.97	2029.8	EN2001b.A.spurt.721
C: Assume uh normal linguistic user	2458.54	2460.53	EN2001d.B.spurt.896 I think that'd be good idea	2458.81	2460.39	EN2001d.A.spurt.897 But i think for me for us like in developing it would be interesting yeah so um	2462.92	2467.51	EN2001d.B.spurt.898 but	2467.51	2467.88	EN2001d.B.spurt.899
D: I dunno it's it's not it's not a nice way i'm just saying	3848.27	3850.6	EN2001e.B.spurt.866 Yeah probably that if you to that if you doing a such a you should not interested in a condensed way but in there	3863.37	3867.64	EN2001e.B.spurt.867 The full thing anyway	3868.04	3869.19	EN2001e.B.spurt.868 Yes	3868.45	3868.91	EN2001e.A.spurt.869

C: Oh i don't know how to draw for that	2476.1	2478.06	EN2001d.D.spurt.902 Or as it's not a problem of doing it like i think it	2478.86	2481.2	EN2001d.B.spurt.903 Okay	2487.91	2488.54	EN2001d.B.spurt.905 And stuff like that	2488.05	2488.93	EN2001d.D.spurt.906
D: And you would otherwise it would be too complicated to cope with with it uh system if you have to we are just that	3871.32	3877.24	EN2001e.A.spurt.870 It it to uh a difference to maybe to get better results	3877.66	3880.46	EN2001e.A.spurt.871 I mean it would be a strangely in the eyes of the user	3882.0	3885.04	EN2001e.A.spurt.872 Yeah	3889.7	3890.17	EN2001e.B.spurt.873
B: Yeah i mean um	2040.72	2041.83	EN2001b.A.spurt.726 we have for us uh our separate topics for example we have a trendy topics	2041.83	2046.92	EN2001b.A.spurt.727 Uh-huh	2047.06	2047.39	EN2001b.B.spurt.728 And um	2047.4	2048.19	EN2001b.A.spurt.729

C: Okay	2650.1	2650.46	EN2001d.C.spurt.965 Two different things	2652.46	2653.56	EN2001d.B.spurt.966 Yeah it's untrue different uh	2654.98	2656.21	EN2001d.A.spurt.967 Yeah i mean making to think in the region	2664.9	2666.82	EN2001d.A.spurt.968
B: And there are a lot of um	2203.47	2206.25	EN2001b.C.spurt.792 So it should work for one but i'm not sure of	2212.95	2215.61	EN2001b.C.spurt.794 You know what as a byproduct of my l. s. a. e. i. e. the provide um	2222.01	2226.76	EN2001b.B.spurt.796 And for peace corps which just tells you all of how	2231.9	2234.76	EN2001b.B.spurt.798
C: Yeah different	2667.85	2668.66	EN2001d.A.spurt.969 Um employers and smugglers and	2669.42	2671.75	EN2001d.A.spurt.970 Was that as long as yeah	2672.62	2674.31	EN2001d.B.spurt.971 So do	2672.96	2673.51	EN2001d.A.spurt.972
B: Uh-huh	2252.25	2252.58	EN2001b.A.spurt.802 And i just provide that because that's just	2261.65	2263.56	EN2001b.B.spurt.804 So if you um keep "'em" work on rainbow mean one and try to	2270.02	2272.73	EN2001b.B.spurt.806 Yeah maybe it's possible	2282.78	2284.27	EN2001b.C.spurt.810
C: Recapitulate me	2674.37	2675.61	EN2001d.A.spurt.973 The rules	2676.07	2676.59	EN2001d.A.spurt.974 As long as everything's in the right order trend	2677.35	2679.47	EN2001d.B.spurt.975 Like we should even be able just idea it when you're reading it in	2679.94	2682.92	EN2001d.B.spurt.976
B: To have a list there that's all of that is all that by	2284.73	2288.13	EN2001b.C.spurt.811 Yeah	2289.76	2290.2	EN2001b.C.spurt.812 No	2291.03	2291.44	EN2001b.C.spurt.813 Just thinking	2291.81	2292.67	EN2001b.B.spurt.814
C: Well we have got the index	2683.77	2685.15	EN2001d.C.spurt.977 Um	2686.05	2686.58	EN2001d.C.spurt.978 Four	2686.9	2687.46	EN2001d.C.spurt.979 Converting from there as a these two years so it should be a problem sure	2688.05	2692.03	EN2001d.C.spurt.980
B: Did you use each word completely unique Like sort of does it treat each word it records of us to go with a unique event or does it i mean i know it it has to mean	2295.11	2304.46	EN2001b.B.spurt.815 Uh-huh	2308.21	2308.52	EN2001b.C.spurt.817 Because it looks if the same but of course again and stuff	2311.32	2313.53	EN2001b.B.spurt.818 Um	2314.84	2315.45	EN2001b.C.spurt.819
C: Yeah i've done that for the correlation	2692.92	2695.5	EN2001d.C.spurt.982 Mm	2693.35	2693.75	EN2001d.B.spurt.983 Yeah	2699.24	2699.47	EN2001d.C.spurt.985 "'kay"	2702.07	2702.6	EN2001d.B.spurt.986
B: Yeah it it has to work with them	2314.85	2316.02	EN2001b.B.spurt.820 i don't know what you mean by that that's it	2315.45	2317.3	EN2001b.C.spurt.821 Yeah i think is is too because like it	2316.78	2318.94	EN2001b.B.spurt.822 It has to work on	2319.34	2320.69	EN2001b.B.spurt.823
C: Have you got a four	2702.14	2703.2	EN2001d.C.spurt.987 Okay	2707.5	2707.94	EN2001d.C.spurt.990 Um	2722.56	2723.63	EN2001d.B.spurt.993 so you was good always like yours can always below that	2723.63	2726.28	EN2001d.B.spurt.994
B: One	2321.53	2321.88	EN2001b.B.spurt.824 Uh-huh	2329.05	2329.42	EN2001b.C.spurt.827 Alright	2329.93	2330.47	EN2001b.C.spurt.828 Mm	2338.25	2338.75	EN2001b.C.spurt.829
C: In a	2727.32	2728.07	EN2001d.B.spurt.995 But you wouldn't have a file open than a box for that then	2734.62	2737.39	EN2001d.B.spurt.997 Point of having it for like can still be i mean those files	2742.82	2746.02	EN2001d.D.spurt.1000 Um	2750.35	2750.6	EN2001d.D.spurt.1003
B: Mm no	2343.31	2344.03	EN2001b.A.spurt.831 Alright	2345.27	2345.87	EN2001b.C.spurt.832 Yeah you you can use um	2346.25	2348.19	EN2001b.C.spurt.833 Some kind of um	2350.84	2352.55	EN2001b.C.spurt.834
C: okay so um	2750.6	2751.45	EN2001d.D.spurt.1004 What is stop stop it should just	2756.83	2758.36	EN2001d.D.spurt.1006 Read them from the d. for place	2758.77	2760.52	EN2001d.D.spurt.1007 Yeah that makes it	2767.78	2768.69	EN2001d.D.spurt.1009
B: plantation	2352.55	2353.31	EN2001b.C.spurt.835 That would lead to have that in the um truncated version then they would it would be output be the um truncated workable probe yeah	2359.47	2365.17	EN2001b.B.spurt.837 Um probably not	2364.4	2365.46	EN2001b.C.spurt.838 No i don't think it would	2365.8	2367.06	EN2001b.B.spurt.839
C: So it's just things so so that was just an end we record	2768.65	2771.11	EN2001d.B.spurt.1010 Um	2771.83	2772.3	EN2001d.B.spurt.1011 see that eighty working and	2772.3	2773.6	EN2001d.B.spurt.1012 Mm is that not getting too much	2788.07	2789.69	EN2001d.B.spurt.1016
B: No no	2365.95	2366.93	EN2001b.C.spurt.840 Yeah maybe i should try something different in this program it for myself	2378.56	2382.13	EN2001b.C.spurt.841 Becomes um	2384.67	2385.76	EN2001b.C.spurt.842 Yeah for now mean the teachers like	2386.8	2388.54	EN2001b.B.spurt.843
C: So we would have	2798.29	2799.17	EN2001d.B.spurt.1018 For jobs and and where	2804.3	2805.39	EN2001d.B.spurt.1020 I like say if you could make a um	2805.6	2807.67	EN2001d.D.spurt.1021 Yeah	2813.95	2814.3	EN2001d.B.spurt.1024
B: Mm	2393.64	2394.1	EN2001b.C.spurt.845 It's let me see if i can demonstrate	2394.91	2397.63	EN2001b.B.spurt.846 So i mean let's just keep on talking in one and i'll try to stop it up	2398.82	2401.97	EN2001b.B.spurt.847 Really telling you how whole real world it's Or how common uh where it is	2416.71	2420.88	EN2001b.B.spurt.851
C: Yeah	2815.51	2815.76	EN2001d.B.spurt.1025 Oh maybe three actually	2816.82	2818.08	EN2001d.D.spurt.1026 The third one An average we can change of parameters for	2822.19	2826.06	EN2001d.D.spurt.1028 Uh-huh	2826.85	2827.4	EN2001d.B.spurt.1029
B: Uh-huh	2419.25	2419.63	EN2001b.C.spurt.852 Mostly for but i think that	2444.46	2445.75	EN2001b.B.spurt.856 Um mm	2449.75	2450.39	EN2001b.B.spurt.857 He's a thing about can uh not gonna stop now because	2456.54	2459.25	EN2001b.B.spurt.858
C: And then yeah i could eat seem like you throw three	2830.82	2833.47	EN2001d.D.spurt.1030 Different a lot of that	2833.93	2834.87	EN2001d.D.spurt.1031 We'll do that not require a speech works and	2836.31	2838.2	EN2001d.B.spurt.1032 And that that that	2839.19	2840.09	EN2001d.B.spurt.1033
B: For granted now	2459.96	2460.93	EN2001b.B.spurt.859 So	2463.02	2463.58	EN2001b.B.spurt.860 If we can uh work of our bases whatever you do you do probably appear work i work base is what you were thoughts on uh	2465.57	2471.59	EN2001b.B.spurt.861 Uh-huh	2470.44	2470.89	EN2001b.C.spurt.862

B: Yes	2475.89	2476.39	EN2001b.A.spurt.864 Yeah i mean i haven't really decided on How would too	2477.59	2481.25	EN2001b.A.spurt.865 This now because um	2483.95	2485.42	EN2001b.A.spurt.867 One i have for example uh	2485.99	2488.05	EN2001b.A.spurt.868
C: Uh no no it's still good because um	2859.95	2861.96	EN2001d.D.spurt.1041 And uh yes and	2864.69	2865.62	EN2001d.D.spurt.1042 Yeah	2866.4	2866.91	EN2001d.D.spurt.1044 no you mean	2866.91	2867.57	EN2001d.D.spurt.1045

B: Super array of	2553.34	2554.43	EN2001b.B.spurt.888 Stop and and talk to devalue for this in once we have this or a	2560.79	2563.88	EN2001b.B.spurt.890 Know what i mean	2579.71	2580.3	EN2001b.B.spurt.892 Yeah but how can we get to know What makes sense as a a function for	2581.92	2587.24	EN2001b.C.spurt.893
C: A two of them are just	2913.21	2914.23	EN2001d.D.spurt.1061 Oh okay	2920.98	2921.56	EN2001d.B.spurt.1063 Okay	2922.13	2922.6	EN2001d.B.spurt.1065 Yeah	2927.43	2928.01	EN2001d.D.spurt.1067

C: No no sure uh maybe just office just to like not even combining them in a sophisticated which is	2929.39	2934.06	EN2001d.B.spurt.1069 Yeah	2934.68	2935.03	EN2001d.D.spurt.1070 Just to	2935.4	2936.15	EN2001d.B.spurt.1071 Yeah	2937.37	2937.78	EN2001d.B.spurt.1072
B: Because we don't have a useful way of automatically evaluating	2595.0	2598.49	EN2001b.B.spurt.899 Um	2599.56	2600.34	EN2001b.B.spurt.900 We don't have a we refuse fully evaluating automatically	2602.44	2605.54	EN2001b.B.spurt.901 What's good what's pad so it's it's probably always gonna be a question of looking at it and saying okay	2606.01	2611.19	EN2001b.B.spurt.902
C: mm	2937.78	2938.26	EN2001d.B.spurt.1073 Uh-huh	2939.54	2940.29	EN2001d.B.spurt.1074 "'kay" shall we wrap it up So sorry i'm composing	2941.86	2945.4	EN2001d.B.spurt.1075 Do you think	2950.83	2951.47	EN2001d.D.spurt.1077
B: this way it works this one This way it works as well	2616.39	2619.28	EN2001b.B.spurt.904 Yeah plus and that you propose um	2619.69	2621.69	EN2001b.A.spurt.905 We we should	2622.52	2623.28	EN2001b.A.spurt.906 Break that down to have um the smallest	2623.81	2627.07	EN2001b.A.spurt.907
C: If i have to do with like flexibly than that probably	2959.15	2963.15	EN2001d.B.spurt.1080 But is it worth any effort um in	2967.22	2968.97	EN2001d.B.spurt.1082 Well that's the thing is can take more like	2968.67	2970.4	EN2001d.D.spurt.1083 An hour or something isn't worth it	2970.81	2972.48	EN2001d.D.spurt.1084

C: "'cause" we never have more than two and we never heard where we did have one or two so in the end	2974.52	2978.5	EN2001d.B.spurt.1085 I guess you probably would have	2982.66	2984.12	EN2001d.B.spurt.1087 Mm	2984.41	2984.72	EN2001d.A.spurt.1088 The september primary so that might	2990.81	2992.56	EN2001d.B.spurt.1090
B: And	2640.61	2641.07	EN2001b.A.spurt.915 To map for you to map it on	2642.76	2644.29	EN2001b.B.spurt.916 So for user fee	2645.33	2646.17	EN2001b.B.spurt.917 Yeah sure but i could then if they if they have um the way you for the sake in a	2645.42	2649.42	EN2001b.A.spurt.918
C: Promises	2996.35	2997.11	EN2001d.D.spurt.1092 Yeah but that we wouldn't so we'd have to have some	2997.43	2999.51	EN2001d.B.spurt.1093 That works for up and stuff	3000.11	3001.54	EN2001d.B.spurt.1094 Mind a need to make a more in uh	3006.37	3008.17	EN2001d.D.spurt.1096
B: What types just give of v.	2649.99	2652.17	EN2001b.A.spurt.919 Important but our	2653.92	2655.3	EN2001b.A.spurt.920 No	2657.03	2657.3	EN2001b.A.spurt.921 Yes	2662.6	2663.0	EN2001b.A.spurt.923
C: Addition	3008.71	3009.38	EN2001d.D.spurt.1097 Is more or less ready to go huh	3013.73	3015.49	EN2001d.D.spurt.1100 But it might attract i think it might not really be worth it to be honest	3015.27	3018.38	EN2001d.B.spurt.1101 A certain the other stuff first of all the other stuff and just provide like something where	3025.04	3028.78	EN2001d.B.spurt.1102
B: Yeah	2663.25	2663.67	EN2001b.C.spurt.924 Yeah but	2663.52	2663.95	EN2001b.B.spurt.925 yeah	2663.67	2663.85	EN2001b.C.spurt.926 The thing	2672.22	2672.71	EN2001b.B.spurt.928
C: Each of them just if if there's a uh	3029.54	3031.61	EN2001d.B.spurt.1103 In the thing	3037.3	3038.01	EN2001d.B.spurt.1105 Okay	3044.56	3044.99	EN2001d.D.spurt.1107 And	3053.43	3054.01	EN2001d.B.spurt.1109

C: Yeah and then they can Soon	3055.27	3057.19	EN2001d.B.spurt.1111 I think it would be cool if we could uh-huh	3066.12	3068.37	EN2001d.B.spurt.1113 Check the night or	3069.03	3070.22	EN2001d.B.spurt.1114 Those ratings and and do something useful than get notified and they change and stuff	3075.2	3079.92	EN2001d.B.spurt.1116
B: Yes sure	2690.44	2691.04	EN2001b.A.spurt.935 "'kay" and and then we could have like some type of just	2694.02	2696.66	EN2001b.B.spurt.936 Point in the end were the ones course from the all the individual work cells Get multiplied or with like for each	2697.13	2703.52	EN2001b.B.spurt.937 It was course	2710.62	2711.44	EN2001b.B.spurt.939
C: Just disconnected from	3084.09	3085.6	EN2001d.D.spurt.1118 Yeah i think	3087.22	3087.76	EN2001d.B.spurt.1120 Like the right is probably property which are the worst "'cause" we get set public	3103.88	3107.36	EN2001d.B.spurt.1122 You might have to	3111.65	3112.47	EN2001d.B.spurt.1124
B: Yeah	2711.9	2712.21	EN2001b.A.spurt.940 Very somehow	2712.74	2713.75	EN2001b.A.spurt.941 Mm hmm	2713.52	2713.98	EN2001b.C.spurt.942 Of the way	2714.18	2714.86	EN2001b.A.spurt.943

C: Yeah i mean just disconnected from whatever it sends the media player	3135.17	3138.38	EN2001d.D.spurt.1134 Yeah	3138.33	3138.7	EN2001d.B.spurt.1135 Yeah	3142.54	3142.86	EN2001d.B.spurt.1137 "'cause" like we could	3144.07	3145.0	EN2001d.D.spurt.1138

B: Hmm	2758.17	2758.6	EN2001b.D.spurt.957 Um no i don't overlap	2759.46	2761.49	EN2001b.A.spurt.958 Hmm	2761.86	2762.28	EN2001b.B.spurt.959 No no they don't but um	2765.22	2766.74	EN2001b.A.spurt.961
C: Uh without actually telling them Or actually means you see why	3158.33	3162.16	EN2001d.D.spurt.1144 Yeah	3159.94	3160.18	EN2001d.B.spurt.1145 Yeah	3161.32	3161.63	EN2001d.B.spurt.1146 Yeah	3162.79	3163.08	EN2001d.B.spurt.1147

C: I think that's sort of a line we should go by in general sort of saying yeah we could have done also many	3173.69	3177.93	EN2001d.B.spurt.1149 That's incredible a unintuitive	3182.25	3184.04	EN2001d.D.spurt.1151 Mm	3183.31	3183.41	EN2001d.B.spurt.1152 Um	3209.82	3210.54	EN2001d.C.spurt.1157
B: Okay	2783.43	2784.12	EN2001b.B.spurt.970 see you could it on their granularity	2784.12	2786.32	EN2001b.B.spurt.971 And i hope so yeah	2791.27	2792.39	EN2001b.A.spurt.974 And uh which	2800.18	2801.11	EN2001b.C.spurt.977
C: according to that then it's not finish it doesn't make any sense	3210.54	3214.06	EN2001d.C.spurt.1158 Well	3210.57	3211.06	EN2001d.D.spurt.1159 Well when make any	3214.4	3215.37	EN2001d.D.spurt.1160 He each changes okay always have to you	3216.0	3218.09	EN2001d.D.spurt.1161
B: They have three way then if we use uh okay this concerns this following words	2806.89	2810.26	EN2001b.B.spurt.978 And then just	2811.03	2811.67	EN2001b.B.spurt.979 Make a simple mean over them	2812.71	2814.11	EN2001b.B.spurt.980 In the x. m. l. file yeah but if we do that in the software then we can probably make ways of playing with it in the soft and sort of you know like	2822.18	2828.14	EN2001b.B.spurt.982
C: Okay	3216.94	3217.51	EN2001d.C.spurt.1162 The ability to read your actual ones that might be quite cool to have a combined make sure	3219.1	3222.95	EN2001d.D.spurt.1163 Like	3223.91	3224.17	EN2001d.D.spurt.1164 Just the way to have for it	3224.92	3226.63	EN2001d.D.spurt.1165
B: Adapting some sort of	2828.8	2830.14	EN2001b.B.spurt.983 Control	2830.88	2831.46	EN2001b.B.spurt.984 Like playing around with look like this playing with different waiting is for	2831.87	2835.77	EN2001b.B.spurt.985 Then after a space from what's the word based on and sort of look at it	2836.86	2840.0	EN2001b.B.spurt.986
C: Okay	3227.19	3227.49	EN2001d.C.spurt.1166 Yeah	3242.18	3242.74	EN2001d.B.spurt.1171 So okay	3242.9	3243.64	EN2001d.C.spurt.1172 Yeah	3252.07	3252.43	EN2001d.B.spurt.1173
