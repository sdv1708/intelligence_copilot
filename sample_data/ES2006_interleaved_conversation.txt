A: we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each	938.96	943.16	ES2006a.C.spurt.418 What functions we need in the remote control and what what specific	210.29	214.03	ES2006a.C.spurt.69 Tell us your name what your role is and perhaps how you are animal would like to the road you're taking in this project	299.01	306.24	ES2006a.C.spurt.100 It's in the conceptual design phase that the identify of the components of our product	237.81	243.34	ES2006a.A.spurt.80
B: Yeah but then the remote control i think i mean it in the idea is kind of uh it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television because then you could already at at the television and you wouldn't you you would need a remote controls of the remote control is still something you keep in me a yourself	1932.46	1947.67	ES2006b.D.spurt.812 And that the main function of the remote control is is just Sending messages to the television set so this quite straightforward and that was some of the main functions would be switching on switch off	749.11	761.5	ES2006b.D.spurt.303 "'kay" when you filling up your hand you know a lot of people for the time with basic well basically in a new poll this stuff and you just like what the hell is that there is there any is it in a setting should either be functional or beautiful or preferably by so i think we need to aim for both	1428.39	1442.29	ES2006b.B.spurt.552 Um i'll put the minutes in that project documents folder but i'll send you an email wanna do it so that you know it should be on your desktop	2075.05	2083.5	ES2006b.C.spurt.874
C: Yeah but i think that the l. c. d. display is kind of yeah it's faster well up middle and we've would be someone we is going to discuss that we might like this flipping open thing then i mean you you can use it as a normal remote control but if you do you want to use l. c. d. then you flip it open but it's it it's more time consuming	1591.17	1608.82	ES2006c.D.spurt.769 i think maybe a way to do it would be assimilate i have your mobile phone you know like you have the slide you want and you have to flip you want and then the screen is protected so it doesn't actually get scratched So you can have a lot what looks like a normal remote control unit or like a minimalist remote controls you will you buttons want to ninety on and off Anybody one that And then if you want to mess about with that you flip it open	1194.89	1216.38	ES2006c.B.spurt.535 On pressing this button I i said that completes The information goes to the chip which is somewhere here And the chip that that and then translates the court into i mean for a infrared radiation Which course goes out so there	157.26	169.98	ES2006c.A.spurt.62 Well if if we have a l. c. d. displays that opens up a whole word you know you if you have an l. c. d. display then them you can select almost everything on the l. c. d. display	1583.47	1592.15	ES2006c.A.spurt.767
D: No it says what what is the kind of interface if it is push button then you get a zero point five it's a scroll-wheel so we we've put a it's push button and a scroll wheel An l. c. d. display	1249.85	1262.18	ES2006d.A.spurt.719 No what what But it it's it's a scroll-wheel um i thought we would have into this as a scroll wheel spinning wheel and push button thing	1374.26	1380.95	ES2006d.A.spurt.787 So that's alright we will leave it a dash and then i'll take the i can send it back to management say We were quite sure about the colour of like a six true that we've still got some specs for	1455.29	1464.2	ES2006d.C.spurt.836 And and you have a dumb spinning wheel was options to choose can go back and forth and then if you needed into something on the screen you just push the cent in the middle button	284.8	294.7	ES2006d.D.spurt.169
A: And during the um conceptual design or the release components of it	744.99	749.48	ES2006a.A.spurt.329 I'm a bit confused about the what's the difference between the functional design conceptual design uh	188.66	194.63	ES2006a.A.spurt.59 what it has to do was that was my role in the project is hard say uh i hope to be loyal to the project trends	578.52	584.0	ES2006a.D.spurt.243 The user requirements specification of the functional design um	428.14	433.07	ES2006a.B.spurt.172
B: The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing During the time So we'll go through it each of you one by one	81.71	90.69	ES2006b.C.spurt.36 the remote control should be used only for television because incorporating other features	336.05	340.33	ES2006b.A.spurt.133 So in the user interface requirements so and that we we have been able to identify what what are the basic buttons that we do want	963.11	970.72	ES2006b.A.spurt.366 But then if you're buying the remote separately but you you could have something but it if it was something that you could like stick onto the t. v. or something Some of like a chip if you bought it in a chip a pack so one product i just a that's a very	1988.57	2001.2	ES2006b.C.spurt.835
C: The buttons are also rubber we have in push buttons on the outside and then on the inside an l. c. d. with spinning wheel um or incorporating voice recognition	2051.99	2060.46	ES2006c.C.spurt.1013 in in the what buttons we have all the channels also we have options do it to be enumerate everything from zero to nine or do we have just the channel plus channel minus just to use a scroll	1619.8	1630.17	ES2006c.A.spurt.784 The the kinetic energy one is that idea uh and but there are uh usually more than watch is since are hand keeps moving it keeps to watch taking i don't know if it is a good idea for a remote control because it would just lie there for a long while sometimes	265.75	279.04	ES2006c.A.spurt.107 Oh that one and and flat and the top because i'm not sure if it's flat on both both the sides and how how much easy would it be to reach for buttons etcetera	1352.95	1361.19	ES2006c.A.spurt.630
D: you can tell you what we get d. is prefer to put had the evaluation of the new design	441.72	446.31	ES2006d.B.spurt.269 In place for it and uh and also the call a squeezable from rate so it's it's kind of user friendly and then this one's would be for flipping the canals back in like the previous one and the next one and then we would also have a little um saying saying chip representing prevent prevent next	243.86	262.24	ES2006d.D.spurt.153 This is a final meeting a Detailed design meeting	6.25	9.75	ES2006d.C.spurt.7 Yeah well yeah but it's it's a bit long it's a little bit long Well i mean it can be open like a base of course and yeah	689.58	696.37	ES2006d.D.spurt.394
A: how how it works and uh whatever so and you during the functional role what are the various functions that have reform buy it	737.6	744.43	ES2006a.A.spurt.328 Complete the project That has sorry Components as such	145.24	149.63	ES2006a.C.spurt.44 These specifics of am project plan	67.24	69.52	ES2006a.C.spurt.26 Not so and left people are doing similar project know the details or project or something	585.83	592.4	ES2006a.D.spurt.246
B: I think i think the fact that you need ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five euro to say yes i would pay more for voice recognition	1692.01	1699.87	ES2006b.B.spurt.689 Uh-huh so so at this stage to how we go about implementing those buttons we will not identify or I mean in that we can complete you two are the buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that	975.13	988.29	ES2006b.A.spurt.370 And um you know i was thinking that solar power be quite cool because you know you might control just sits there you could just sit in the sunshine and save the environment a bit	1446.9	1454.96	ES2006b.B.spurt.555 the latest features in our chip design so that are are um	516.16	520.71	ES2006b.A.spurt.191
C: The whole idea with the l. c. d.s and the spinning in the colours and the voice recognition is quite like	1107.7	1112.64	ES2006c.B.spurt.487 And and which uh the making is that the user uses to control its operation and input data so this would include things like shape and size and buttons and And voice recognition as well and colour and so on	671.49	684.55	ES2006c.D.spurt.300 inexpensive so we can put in that whatever we want to But the base integrated circuit options are	458.35	463.81	ES2006c.A.spurt.211 If it's made of rubber you should get the kinetic energy fairly easy way you could use	1331.99	1335.89	ES2006c.B.spurt.605
D: Rubber rubber comes colours it's i would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured all wood coloured that's different	1174.89	1180.73	ES2006d.C.spurt.668 Most colour the the colour of the phone on the colour of the	1515.42	1518.36	ES2006d.D.spurt.872 The volume is is scrolling on the side this one you just do it like this and and and it's it's on the back is um a cover more back	263.5	271.6	ES2006d.D.spurt.158 It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up right so it opens and the side	670.87	675.14	ES2006d.A.spurt.381
A: my and my role in the project is a um	726.59	729.08	ES2006a.A.spurt.324 It is like a euro	704.0	704.99	ES2006a.B.spurt.300 And with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million euros	945.72	950.03	ES2006a.C.spurt.420 Twelve and a half euro	966.47	967.66	ES2006a.C.spurt.427
B: Put the main function of the remote control in in words	741.88	745.25	ES2006b.D.spurt.299 Um i take fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons as came back to what you know saying idea about in a	1203.4	1210.4	ES2006b.B.spurt.451 the possibility of speech recognition l. c. d. screens your remote control well actually get many ounces on the l. c. d. screen so she's taken up at that you're	1148.54	1157.08	ES2006b.B.spurt.432 i'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check and then there's the shape project documents folder	44.34	51.08	ES2006b.C.spurt.17
C: Oh uh l. c. d.s are basically for feedback right to use it was pressing buttons And a feedback can come to the television itself so do we need an c. d. on the remote	1143.31	1151.79	ES2006c.A.spurt.515 and that you'd a recogniser is the the voice of the speech get there can be uh uh and preprogrammed on set for example you can pick up the remote control and say you something to it like l. a. and it says the hell are and your name with a	867.7	882.06	ES2006c.D.spurt.375 The colour like vegetable colours t. v. so you could have like i mean aspect which was would be orange and green and some ads	1824.2	1831.53	ES2006c.B.spurt.901 If you've got a flip thing effectively at something that's curved on one side and flash on the other side but you fold it in half	1728.87	1735.76	ES2006c.C.spurt.848
D: Scroll wheel with push button we had no	1193.76	1196.33	ES2006d.C.spurt.682 Unless we just take off the scroll wheel together in just a push buttons for volume	1415.06	1419.11	ES2006d.B.spurt.808 You know and and you can push this one but we don't have a A pushbutton i would we don't have this meeting mechanism for the scrolling thing	1360.63	1367.7	ES2006d.D.spurt.781 I used to send fifty text a day you know and i never got repetitive strain injury from that's our find it quite hard to believe c. n. s.	869.74	876.18	ES2006d.B.spurt.497
A: Familiar with all kinds of animals but i do like dogs oh sorry maybe i should have shouldn't have said it beforehand	513.2	518.67	ES2006a.D.spurt.213 Well my favourite animal is is that how how important know like yellow control as well	672.99	677.25	ES2006a.A.spurt.278 This design project	15.71	16.81	ES2006a.C.spurt.5 Can we want to practice using some of the tools that will be using doing the the course of the design project in the meetings	51.43	58.59	ES2006a.C.spurt.21
B: "'kay" these the people that will pay more for more stylish remote control bomb a seeming key name yes	1556.52	1561.73	ES2006b.B.spurt.604 Yeah if we to if we take fifteen to thirty five but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate Voice recognition is that gonna have a an implication for the	1720.66	1729.34	ES2006b.C.spurt.698 in the design like operating a v. c. r. but they don't seem to be able to deal with d. v. d. players but then there are actually there are many of the functional the functions that could possibly be added to them but according to the last minutes update um	813.32	829.56	ES2006b.D.spurt.324 The agenda for the meeting i put it in this shared documents folder i don't know	31.03	36.71	ES2006b.C.spurt.11
C: And it would be like um if you could make integrate with the t. v. then it could come up with your information about what's on and you could just see that on the remote lot of them	1183.48	1190.93	ES2006c.B.spurt.529 So and they have they can even have an an integrated the push button inside the scrolling	415.57	420.62	ES2006c.A.spurt.193 The slack a completely flat case is definitely out tried it has to be at least go from one side yeah	1496.33	1501.89	ES2006c.A.spurt.709 Okay we decided to include voice recognition	971.3	973.81	ES2006c.D.spurt.426
D: Later because If you flip it open you can still do the scrolling yeah	272.19	276.18	ES2006d.D.spurt.162 So the volume is you you just scroll but then once you flip it open	278.23	281.85	ES2006d.D.spurt.166 Is a bit of a meeting is in a yeah	1685.54	1687.6	ES2006d.B.spurt.983 This thing is kind of more for right-handed people than left-handed people say if you're left-handed That kind of that uh scrolling with your finger	597.06	604.88	ES2006d.A.spurt.343
A: and the interface design in this project	504.35	506.46	ES2006a.D.spurt.211 And similarly with the conceptual design	167.54	170.79	ES2006a.C.spurt.51 Things that it has to do the conceptual design is	214.44	217.55	ES2006a.C.spurt.71 i think it's it's in the conceptual design phase out there and the	233.85	236.82	ES2006a.A.spurt.79
B: No we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes To ourselves to prepare a star that's fine but	2156.57	2163.38	ES2006b.C.spurt.926 Television how how how are are a remote control would only be dealing the with the uh the use for television	349.89	356.85	ES2006b.A.spurt.138 Summarisation which you'll get immediately by email send me your presentations so that i can use them to make a minute	2058.94	2065.15	ES2006b.C.spurt.867 yeah so now we are here at the functional design meeting	15.79	19.96	ES2006b.C.spurt.7
C: yeah we seem ipods not made of Well but then i have a little more the case the case the the top of it and i can change the colour	1764.0	1770.47	ES2006c.B.spurt.865 Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned the the the l. c. display	830.85	835.63	ES2006c.D.spurt.358 It's like wait you know you have d. a. q. mouse and you go around it is kind of a that it needs to spend round in it	923.16	929.67	ES2006c.B.spurt.397 Yeah but but i i'm not completely completely clear uh i uh	1692.79	1696.81	ES2006c.D.spurt.829
D: The scroll wheel is on the side	1399.66	1401.79	ES2006d.C.spurt.798 If it in the l. c. d. we can scroll right how do we make a selection if you do cannot push the button	1356.93	1361.67	ES2006d.A.spurt.780 The instead of having scrolling we we just push the button	1483.17	1485.81	ES2006d.A.spurt.851 Going on working individually and then coming back to a meeting that	1615.96	1619.18	ES2006d.C.spurt.931
A: trendwatching in the conceptual design	433.07	435.01	ES2006a.B.spurt.173 Uh then in the uh in the conceptual design the states are in need to	621.77	627.23	ES2006a.D.spurt.260 Remote control for television	100.91	102.62	ES2006a.C.spurt.35 The remote control	155.95	156.85	ES2006a.C.spurt.48
B: The basic findings from today the last three bullets have the integrated from uh the last minute	294.67	299.95	ES2006b.A.spurt.115 See uh from the design functional design perspective	235.12	239.58	ES2006b.A.spurt.95 Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly	1170.39	1174.08	ES2006b.B.spurt.437 There's basically an energy source at the heart	385.85	388.38	ES2006b.A.spurt.153
C: maybe powerful and uh and then you pick that Buttons and company colours to match that	1833.11	1838.64	ES2006c.B.spurt.905 Okay if you go over to an integrated circuits	1843.45	1846.39	ES2006c.A.spurt.910 Uh integrated circuits	1993.86	1995.32	ES2006c.A.spurt.990 So it's advanced integrated circuit	1997.49	1999.48	ES2006c.B.spurt.992
D: And then i will explain be the user interface So any of things like the buttons and the scrolling thing	107.7	113.47	ES2006d.D.spurt.60 And it's gonna make a bit smaller and and of course it would be shiny and it yet but uh one thing we actually kind of	184.73	191.41	ES2006d.D.spurt.116 but the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute right	315.16	318.37	ES2006d.D.spurt.187 Say i mean that was kind of negate the whole r. s. i. a. she say maybe we need for that means a little bit investigation maybe give it a five hours a a cheap what you think	644.65	654.17	ES2006d.B.spurt.370
A: Um on the remote control	619.6	621.3	ES2006a.D.spurt.259 Um we're planning to sell these remote controls for its make it go away	931.67	935.96	ES2006a.C.spurt.415 Remote control	1020.35	1021.06	ES2006a.C.spurt.440 Want to have "'em" want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones	1026.47	1032.22	ES2006a.D.spurt.442
B: which feeds into the chip and the user interface	389.34	392.13	ES2006b.A.spurt.155 The user and for the interface communicates with the chip	392.82	395.5	ES2006b.A.spurt.156 So i'm going to speak about technical functions design and it just like some	682.0	686.91	ES2006b.D.spurt.277 Who are target group is going to be and what the functions of the remote control	113.42	117.68	ES2006b.C.spurt.46
C: I would say this is the spinning there is a high speed to the to the scrolling wheels so you have to decide would be	1709.24	1714.75	ES2006c.B.spurt.839 Teenage easy ten ten to get a flat vegetables	1254.98	1257.63	ES2006c.B.spurt.562 Kinetic energy to seem to have some kind of uh	1467.56	1470.7	ES2006c.A.spurt.692 Looking at what we've got a fish We we we want an l. c. d. display with the spinning wheel	1445.71	1451.2	ES2006c.C.spurt.676
D: Present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be	33.09	36.43	ES2006d.C.spurt.20 Evaluating this against	36.84	38.12	ES2006d.C.spurt.21 Our product fixed price the evaluation criteria from cat and uh	52.38	55.87	ES2006d.C.spurt.28 and then we will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of	59.31	63.35	ES2006d.C.spurt.31
A: Included in this remote control that	1053.13	1054.8	ES2006a.C.spurt.449 I mean i know what a mess the button to oh my remote controls are could have need you need to me	1108.64	1113.09	ES2006a.B.spurt.469 it's a huge problem for remote controls and in a battery life uh	1197.08	1200.29	ES2006a.A.spurt.512 But we do we identify the components of our Well product um	228.98	233.85	ES2006a.A.spurt.78
B: You need is a menu remote control beeping and p. five minute "'cause" you	1480.76	1485.17	ES2006b.B.spurt.569 like voice recognition being more popular with the younger people So if we need to have a target group	1523.46	1530.59	ES2006b.A.spurt.590 Is so these are the ascension so at all the functionality of the remote control whatever new functions that we need to do um	471.31	479.4	ES2006b.A.spurt.177 Basically update and come up for the new designs it's a cyclical process	284.91	288.49	ES2006b.A.spurt.111
C: The printed circuit board and this is the most important point here uh	137.48	142.15	ES2006c.A.spurt.55 it cannot be used on a double curved surface if we choose this we can't choose titanium	376.83	381.47	ES2006c.A.spurt.176 using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one I mean although it does seem uh um	1902.17	1909.09	ES2006c.A.spurt.942 Quite like the idea of a scroll the scrolling button as Could be for for voice like i dunno it in like um	992.71	999.5	ES2006c.D.spurt.436
D: so maybe if we go on to evaluation criteria and then we'll	381.94	386.64	ES2006d.C.spurt.247 Also a in that case i'm not sure that you uh evaluate this as a corpus of this because it's just rubber so it's probably a flat surface rubber or i mean	1322.44	1331.62	ES2006d.A.spurt.766 Oh now evaluation criteria was the real sort of doing that	1472.58	1476.04	ES2006d.C.spurt.845 we've evaluated	1838.05	1839.25	ES2006d.C.spurt.1090
A: The identification of the components are holding it could be cheaper	759.82	762.93	ES2006a.A.spurt.334 The functional design	151.18	153.06	ES2006a.C.spurt.46 I think that we talking that the functional design is more	198.96	203.1	ES2006a.C.spurt.64 That initially with the functional design	247.07	249.33	ES2006a.C.spurt.83
B: We need to buy the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on	108.8	112.95	ES2006b.C.spurt.45 No but but the so we did say that and things like voice recognition are more popular with them so if you want to put in something stylish than uh	1562.49	1570.08	ES2006b.A.spurt.606 okay but that she is how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software	1359.42	1364.45	ES2006b.B.spurt.527 Oh quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software	1373.02	1375.63	ES2006b.B.spurt.530
C: Something that voice recognition or not but anyway so the other different options that we have	554.1	558.78	ES2006c.A.spurt.247 This is basically send information to look uh transistor yeah	127.83	131.29	ES2006c.A.spurt.50 uh i mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company and the buttons	1817.97	1821.61	ES2006c.B.spurt.899 "'cause" i'm a bit like we came back type of the again room the whole spinning wheel but i have like uh	1758.52	1764.0	ES2006c.B.spurt.864
D: basically going with that kind of vegetables and uh i do we selected colour	116.14	121.37	ES2006d.A.spurt.64 If i if if this means it's easier if it means the way people kind of i used to finding things and it's five	752.37	758.92	ES2006d.D.spurt.442 Scroll where have scroll wheel as well	1191.42	1193.35	ES2006d.D.spurt.681 but that's alright if you take in a rough and then all of them and	580.71	583.81	ES2006d.B.spurt.331
A: Yeah it in designing the technical functions of um	615.14	618.46	ES2006a.D.spurt.258 You're looking at the technical functions design	1259.63	1261.88	ES2006a.C.spurt.540 I'm the industrial designer so i'm supposed to design all the	729.55	734.05	ES2006a.A.spurt.325 specifically the whiteboard	59.81	61.15	ES2006a.C.spurt.23
B: so put in in there is the best if i send you an email maybe to	62.32	65.93	ES2006b.C.spurt.27 Hopefully this meeting are we doing a little bit less talking and i did last time "'cause" this is when you get to shows what you've been	22.09	28.36	ES2006b.C.spurt.9 "'cause" it's it's quite important you did you use the the bit to locate the remote control	2000.5	2004.29	ES2006b.B.spurt.844 Before you start to make it easier would you three mind emailing me your presentations once we you don't have to do it now but where once you go back Just so that i don't have to scribble everything yeah	204.09	216.01	ES2006b.C.spurt.79
C: They are got one today is um tenuous boxes And you put the number in the remote and then you wait in any case the t. v. in any way you can then it comes so we actually is quite a long time	1155.87	1166.24	ES2006c.B.spurt.519 would would be flat and what the sides would be code from one side or	333.66	337.31	ES2006c.A.spurt.143 And spinning wheel which you can incorporate buttons and t.	2089.97	2092.78	ES2006c.B.spurt.1030 But if you get the number moment it's a bit of a pain so i think in a screen on them i would probably	1166.77	1171.92	ES2006c.B.spurt.522
D: Alright	1468.08	1468.68	ES2006d.C.spurt.842 Alright then	1494.92	1495.62	ES2006d.C.spurt.858 That's alright that always irritates me anyway	1698.55	1700.68	ES2006d.C.spurt.993 so basically so is the flip open thing that can	147.39	150.45	ES2006d.A.spurt.91
A: Specifically the whiteboard	276.5	278.32	ES2006a.C.spurt.91 What specific things could be	1048.93	1050.87	ES2006a.C.spurt.447 You will you be getting specific instructions once you go back to your work space for them Basically	1248.41	1254.78	ES2006a.C.spurt.537 And for you it's the user requirements Specification like to start	1263.85	1268.38	ES2006a.C.spurt.541
B: Um so is all of our o. k. a. how people feel about the look-and-feel of the remote control unit will see most annoying things about remote controls	1139.45	1147.31	ES2006b.B.spurt.430 and among the findings i've found that most of the car and presently available remote controls also include all the um	802.76	811.31	ES2006b.D.spurt.321 So you know think that defeats the objects and having voice recognition remote control way	1913.55	1918.32	ES2006b.B.spurt.803 well known them on the voice recognition that if if it works wonderfully we could possibly uh do what was all buttons but i think this is not really the right moment it's because people are just so used a buttons and um	1829.83	1840.53	ES2006b.D.spurt.763
C: It doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spending things you cannot include everything in a spinning if you	1700.84	1707.17	ES2006c.D.spurt.832 is another new development is the scroll button which was also there are also already mentioned	837.14	841.84	ES2006c.D.spurt.362 The size here for sides to this thing so i mean just have one side mean one side is straight	1386.74	1392.1	ES2006c.B.spurt.642 What are you sure what what this means a spinning we all with the l. c. display uh	891.65	895.94	ES2006c.A.spurt.381
D: Yeah but before flip it open only as much as that	705.11	707.44	ES2006d.D.spurt.408 for a remote control really all this flipping open thing and	1777.19	1780.63	ES2006d.D.spurt.1043 We just got rid of a gimmick that was number and then anyway and the scroll-wheel is i mean essentially the t. buttons that is is not great different same thing	1484.91	1493.1	ES2006d.B.spurt.853 But the the spinning wheels not yeah	1215.35	1217.88	ES2006d.C.spurt.697
A: Draw your favourite animal	290.93	292.12	ES2006a.C.spurt.96 Your favourite characteristics of that animal huh	294.82	296.94	ES2006a.C.spurt.98 And my favourite animal i'm i mean i'm not so sure because i'm not so so very um	506.99	512.74	ES2006a.D.spurt.212 Well as compared to small animals like cats um	562.07	564.97	ES2006a.D.spurt.235
B: That like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep you messed up to be something that encourages know something then i dunno like to design the encourages could use of the remote control and	1333.95	1343.97	ES2006b.B.spurt.516 Um on on on the what all bridget project documents yeah	56.65	60.55	ES2006b.D.spurt.21 Project documents	60.24	61.23	ES2006b.C.spurt.22 Yeah it's it's kind of uh it's a fast so we we need both so the voice recognition would be just an extra it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote	1841.21	1849.35	ES2006b.D.spurt.765
C: And the other ones the little bit inside we	2107.95	2109.74	ES2006c.B.spurt.1042 and the chip basically include same for uh infrared sender	510.38	513.4	ES2006c.A.spurt.230 Or or at the corner of the edges just the edges court by rubber or something like that everything else and plastic are we wouldn't titanium if you want to do that	1747.58	1755.3	ES2006c.A.spurt.858 Gene a Is it is not Tactical i'm a disease or if a table but for a remote control unit	1543.87	1549.98	ES2006c.B.spurt.740
D: But that was spinning wheel yeah	1215.44	1217.6	ES2006d.D.spurt.698 i mean that would actually cost anymore that's a spinning wheel though isn't it than that come with the l. c.	1387.43	1392.14	ES2006d.B.spurt.791 So that's that's a three kind of interfaces that we have	1262.64	1265.68	ES2006d.A.spurt.725 And it flips up on the side	157.71	159.24	ES2006d.A.spurt.95
A: Alright favourite animal	670.49	672.16	ES2006a.A.spurt.277 faceplate us to introduce the project Briefly	35.97	39.38	ES2006a.C.spurt.16 Sorry this is our project	94.66	96.01	ES2006a.C.spurt.33 Okay so that's just a brief overview of the the project itself	258.02	262.28	ES2006a.C.spurt.86
B: Yeah i know i mean i know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five euros but i mean it has been proven that the people at that age group have a high disposable income because uh you know like i mean you know if you university you're paying you when you can home mortgage another life insurance policy in	1622.62	1638.23	ES2006b.B.spurt.644 uh remote control does not become outdated so on and it's compatible with more most the televisions	520.71	526.89	ES2006b.A.spurt.192 Uh we had an integrated this into the product design data technical level	278.29	282.99	ES2006b.A.spurt.109 After lunch we go back to our own	2068.99	2070.94	ES2006b.C.spurt.872
C: It it is also quite nice to to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen so if you're watching something	1176.56	1182.8	ES2006c.C.spurt.525 Uh otherwise it people don't want to flip through all the channels	1633.66	1636.73	ES2006c.D.spurt.787 Yeah so the car to decide you hold chip think	1224.07	1226.66	ES2006c.B.spurt.544 And be in bright vegetable colours	2067.29	2069.72	ES2006c.C.spurt.1017
D: Can still put them on the side	1420.1	1421.76	ES2006d.B.spurt.809 I mean yeah i'd uh i dunno i mean that the repetitive stress things but then we would be you're really pushing the buttons so much on uh	854.5	861.42	ES2006d.D.spurt.488 We we definitely going to have to So we got push button and them	1186.83	1191.05	ES2006d.C.spurt.678 with the with the push button means that	1241.79	1244.24	ES2006d.C.spurt.714
A: Start using some of the tools that we using for for the project	271.54	275.66	ES2006a.C.spurt.90 I'm your project manager for	876.67	878.53	ES2006a.C.spurt.393 Project We've got	929.39	931.02	ES2006a.C.spurt.414 Excellent um what's it what's your role within that in	405.12	407.53	ES2006a.C.spurt.164
B: Which basically find out um how how to do everything	425.74	429.19	ES2006b.A.spurt.163 This for the help us uh or to operate that technology at the feature point of time	506.16	510.88	ES2006b.A.spurt.188 So when when the user presses a button which feeds into the chip	433.69	436.64	ES2006b.A.spurt.165 But changing should next channel to to flip through all all all the possible channels or uh then um what are the other possible that would be that it and she miked Just want to choose one particular channel so	769.06	781.92	ES2006b.D.spurt.307
C: The aim i think for for the kind of um but uh channel numbers you still need them within yeah	1576.39	1580.68	ES2006c.D.spurt.760 Basically the shape of the cases they can be flat	306.73	309.62	ES2006c.A.spurt.128 I mean you can flip it open	1214.14	1215.63	ES2006c.C.spurt.539 But flips open	1340.6	1341.33	ES2006c.C.spurt.615
D: Production and design We've been through so we've got forty minutes	63.93	68.14	ES2006d.C.spurt.32 for court one designing it once i was supposed to be round this or is it the backside round yeah	192.45	197.97	ES2006d.D.spurt.119 uh the atomic ergonomic design well	850.16	852.37	ES2006d.D.spurt.485 Looks like we've Design they	1544.39	1546.58	ES2006d.C.spurt.891
A: so is there anything else you'd like to add alright my role is um	599.98	604.39	ES2006a.D.spurt.253 And my role is basically two	880.16	882.24	ES2006a.C.spurt.395 Kind of thing	224.94	225.44	ES2006a.C.spurt.76 well there are different kinds of talks okay	525.53	528.09	ES2006a.D.spurt.218
B: a few basic the components of the remote	230.34	233.0	ES2006b.A.spurt.93 since since i'm dealing only with the technical aspects that would need feedback from the marketing percent	268.07	273.81	ES2006b.A.spurt.107 And then i'll send them to you after the meeting	77.44	80.0	ES2006b.C.spurt.35 Yeah but then the code word would be even more important because i mean sky advertise on every channel In a in a it's a then it would be you'd be watching john and then discard try to come on and it would change the skyline	1880.05	1893.58	ES2006b.B.spurt.782
C: L. c. d.s can only come with the advanced chip	494.38	496.59	ES2006c.A.spurt.223 This can help us to decide which we just want to incorporate You know what	715.78	719.96	ES2006c.D.spurt.315 i didn't mention that i have i think the the old one the options that we have that the cases at least three	1404.05	1409.52	ES2006c.A.spurt.650 Flat on the top	1952.61	1953.54	ES2006c.A.spurt.971
D: Management for next on the design a new product	1567.17	1569.52	ES2006d.C.spurt.903 And uh even the scroll it sits in your technology so my my might be a little more difficult for people to get used in the biggest oh it is kind of not very intuitive	774.37	783.41	ES2006d.A.spurt.450 Yeah basis calling to make isn't it	318.74	320.47	ES2006d.B.spurt.189 Call them slimy I hate today's just mean	373.38	376.26	ES2006d.B.spurt.241
A: they're kind of put this to know where	717.67	719.98	ES2006a.A.spurt.315 Yeah but that's a kind of lizard	844.54	846.41	ES2006a.C.spurt.375 You need some kind of thinking in a like those findings so they have	1093.76	1098.75	ES2006a.B.spurt.464 So there was a little less crowded and it's like i mean you need theoretically you could you all kinds of things you t. v. right but what the most people they they turn it on they watch certain specified channels	1119.56	1130.38	ES2006a.B.spurt.472
B: Concepts and something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition will fall off the map or something but	2135.31	2143.78	ES2006b.C.spurt.915 i just identified the functional components	565.09	567.19	ES2006b.A.spurt.208 Design so my personal preferences would be uh	835.54	839.55	ES2006b.D.spurt.328 Oh acts is circuitry for this meeting in just a minute As we go through	72.51	76.96	ES2006b.C.spurt.34
C: So it in or what do we have the spinning wheel inside with the l. c. d. would it be on the l. to	2070.54	2076.42	ES2006c.D.spurt.1019 we can uh in in for voice recognition and um	820.81	823.77	ES2006c.D.spurt.353 Wants uh it it it's it comes together what the voice recognition but it's once once the um	862.48	867.7	ES2006c.D.spurt.374 Well i would definitely going in for voice recognition as well	2004.72	2008.62	ES2006c.A.spurt.996
D: We just Send all of our manufacturing to	402.82	405.56	ES2006d.C.spurt.253 Call it a does it match the operating behaviour of the user	587.65	590.64	ES2006d.B.spurt.336 Send it	1939.71	1940.23	ES2006d.C.spurt.1154 Yeah because i mean anyway irritate people would be able to scroll wheels and so it it's the majority a right-handed it's yeah	635.8	641.97	ES2006d.D.spurt.363
A: So we should kind of fit in as well and uh	1222.21	1226.19	ES2006a.A.spurt.525 So if you're kinda sad case the nays higher may control works	1145.91	1149.45	ES2006a.B.spurt.491 And um says something that is silly and stylish but it's still functional	1088.46	1093.09	ES2006a.B.spurt.462 There's a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time but will be used ten percent of the time	1132.91	1139.55	ES2006a.A.spurt.479
B: um but the remote control wherever it is it will beep so we can probably come to know where it is	1984.42	1989.35	ES2006b.A.spurt.832 well i think the the buttons are still kind of the most in easy for the user to use i mean and what are the options we do have a little screen or something that this would be really	993.16	1003.33	ES2006b.D.spurt.375 So what another thing will uh that can be used is that the that can be a beep or button on the t. v. so you can go and press that button and uh	1974.9	1984.42	ES2006b.A.spurt.830 That's the the main goal was to come up with those two things target group and	118.09	122.69	ES2006b.C.spurt.47
C: Yeah but you spinning wheel tends to go to one side	1734.83	1738.28	ES2006c.B.spurt.849 Or titanium	345.59	346.51	ES2006c.A.spurt.152 certain titanium's also used to uh in the company to make the	362.65	366.0	ES2006c.A.spurt.171 For for these two we can use titanium	381.97	384.2	ES2006c.A.spurt.177
D: Take it down to just a scroll wheel	1346.32	1348.27	ES2006d.C.spurt.776 i mean the scroll wheels pretty cool but	1424.66	1426.73	ES2006d.B.spurt.812 But i mean if we can put an addition mute button on that's all possible	1381.18	1385.28	ES2006d.D.spurt.788 See i was gonna say the scroll-wheel pushbutton think	1341.63	1345.09	ES2006d.B.spurt.774
A: and then the detailed design will come huh	182.19	184.3	ES2006a.C.spurt.55 Um sports event evaluation in the detailed design	435.78	439.04	ES2006a.B.spurt.174 Stages of the design so at first i would responsible for	608.08	612.1	ES2006a.D.spurt.255 Uh i would be responsible for being in fit for the user interface design	634.9	638.39	ES2006a.D.spurt.264
B: Well i was thinking is that there is this a separation between what the channels are on t. v. And how they are numbered on the remote control	1853.22	1861.6	ES2006b.A.spurt.771 Functions of the remote control	123.38	125.1	ES2006b.C.spurt.48 So we need to do a with that functionality of the remote control	327.84	331.44	ES2006b.A.spurt.129 Okay so he he is a functional or feel of the remote control	379.96	383.84	ES2006b.A.spurt.151
C: Titanium ford	1322.01	1323.46	ES2006c.A.spurt.599 As we as you get uh make a an electric shock a few remote control if it was made for	1299.57	1303.88	ES2006c.B.spurt.589 I mean is it came out to the to go off at the beginning i made why you know it the buttons the people use all the time you want buttons for them	1608.79	1615.5	ES2006c.B.spurt.776 "'kay" downey time and that will always do tend to of going about a bit	1172.53	1176.02	ES2006c.B.spurt.523
D: What we have to get through in this meeting it is Firstly The prototype presentation for me too So you can shows what you've been working on	15.76	23.96	ES2006d.C.spurt.10 I like a cool so that's uh that's also whole meeting she	322.28	324.84	ES2006d.B.spurt.192 For the meeting yeah	1196.88	1197.82	ES2006d.C.spurt.683 Yeah oh yeah we had before meeting yeah	1197.36	1199.29	ES2006d.D.spurt.685
A: them Detailed design i i guess it will again be	756.49	759.25	ES2006a.A.spurt.333 Something to keep in mind with the designing	991.57	993.65	ES2006a.C.spurt.431 You can't access because you have no idea how to get mean that the designers not a great	1230.38	1234.49	ES2006a.C.spurt.531 You're looking at the working design	1255.46	1257.69	ES2006a.C.spurt.538
B: Do you need all the buttons on the remote control is make it like eighty	1210.84	1213.85	ES2006b.B.spurt.455 Um and everything else i i think in a you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control "'cause" they just don't need it and then we just	1292.04	1298.49	ES2006b.B.spurt.499 And uh i don't know how often they're buying televisions	1583.08	1586.96	ES2006b.C.spurt.616 Still have the buttons so it's easy to use but only do is Key buttons the major buttons them in mind sort of menu one	2028.5	2035.16	ES2006b.C.spurt.856
C: So probably always recognition is is kind of	1130.77	1133.55	ES2006c.A.spurt.505 But we still need to think about the colour of a remote as such you know just keep black or	1799.0	1803.18	ES2006c.A.spurt.887 And then they pick out of the main remote it	1822.02	1823.73	ES2006c.B.spurt.900 In a it's like how you put your hand same At least movement basically	1368.33	1372.24	ES2006c.B.spurt.635
D: all we need we've just got about ten minutes also the left of the meetings so it	1552.96	1557.15	ES2006d.C.spurt.898 I think is a meeting so say a regular uh you know it was my real aim for very long so you didn't	1620.93	1625.54	ES2006d.B.spurt.934 Uh yeah but i mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting yeah	1702.76	1707.75	ES2006d.D.spurt.997 You shouldn't have that Dragon meeting on just because you have extra time	1898.29	1902.01	ES2006d.C.spurt.1126
A: Well matched	1.37	2.17	ES2006a.C.spurt.1 Okay	8.69	9.28	ES2006a.C.spurt.2 So this is a	10.66	12.5	ES2006a.C.spurt.3 First meeting of	13.14	14.39	ES2006a.C.spurt.4
B: what the user might design yeah as i additional uh functionality is	732.46	737.05	ES2006b.D.spurt.296 Should the power power good groups what does that mean	133.61	136.77	ES2006b.A.spurt.52 And there's a lot of for voice recognition right controls	1826.51	1829.89	ES2006b.B.spurt.761 sitting on off channel	792.96	794.78	ES2006b.A.spurt.315
C: Go to one side flat	316.18	317.4	ES2006c.A.spurt.134 this time i'm i mentioned them already in the previous talk So um	644.27	647.89	ES2006c.D.spurt.286 As it is to watch which constantly keeps moving this this thing we'll have to be tapped every time which which might be	1476.46	1481.53	ES2006c.A.spurt.698 I would think because you need to unit you need to put all the technology and so it i mean if the case you have the case and	1519.59	1526.34	ES2006c.D.spurt.719
D: The end of that meeting	1905.87	1906.92	ES2006d.C.spurt.1130 Right so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when a	1934.67	1939.23	ES2006d.C.spurt.1152 Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons there are four up and down	1427.91	1431.17	ES2006d.A.spurt.814 So it opens like that	159.7	161.13	ES2006d.A.spurt.96
A: Um	17.62	18.32	ES2006a.C.spurt.6 And	18.81	19.42	ES2006a.C.spurt.7 I am like to show you the agenda for the meeting	19.99	22.66	ES2006a.C.spurt.8 I don't know if it was saying round	23.13	24.58	ES2006a.C.spurt.9
B: this is the bit to the email myself i mean that's what i was thinking about a look at you like	1300.23	1304.18	ES2006b.B.spurt.502 "'kay" not straining your wrist Watching t. v.	1344.47	1347.52	ES2006b.B.spurt.519 A buying you watched on say we couldn't	1786.96	1788.93	ES2006b.B.spurt.736 But it's still if if you can go back to that slide and uh well how popular was it	1601.88	1606.35	ES2006b.A.spurt.628
C: Several okay and anyone hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder would be could just so in case we have to refer to it	2152.95	2160.43	ES2006c.C.spurt.1061 And the case is curved on one side but then	1949.67	1952.08	ES2006c.C.spurt.970 Curved on one side case which is folded in on itself	2042.92	2046.15	ES2006c.C.spurt.1010 These these are the kind of kind of batteries that the company makes	220.43	223.26	ES2006c.A.spurt.79
D: Is it's a scale a d. v. make a bit smaller	181.23	183.7	ES2006d.B.spurt.115 Open	651.17	651.55	ES2006d.C.spurt.372 So is really hard to live on this this went a bit mad to know	820.03	822.77	ES2006d.B.spurt.472 A little bit or six	984.52	985.85	ES2006d.D.spurt.584
A: To you	25.43	26.18	ES2006a.C.spurt.10 Mm yeah	27.99	29.42	ES2006a.D.spurt.11 Then you know anyway	29.69	30.69	ES2006a.C.spurt.12 And the receiver "'kay"	29.94	31.08	ES2006a.D.spurt.13
B: Oh yeah put them in there yeah then you don't have to email them	2099.92	2103.15	ES2006b.C.spurt.890 The them but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular right so on my are uh	1684.86	1690.63	ES2006b.A.spurt.683 most like sophisticated features	1732.31	1734.3	ES2006b.A.spurt.704 Power channel selection volume selection	1262.27	1264.86	ES2006b.B.spurt.488
C: Kind of energy it needs	1486.15	1487.58	ES2006c.A.spurt.702 A circuit board here	122.41	123.69	ES2006c.A.spurt.48 So if you So if the circuit board is that what it looks like	145.63	148.43	ES2006c.A.spurt.59 That the configurations all of these practical circuit boards Ah are quite can be a good than printed as you want to So we can have a configuration well um	176.62	188.65	ES2006c.A.spurt.65
D: No wait a little bit on the six no wait	988.7	991.41	ES2006d.D.spurt.589 But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really is no you can afford to go to that	1292.64	1296.0	ES2006d.B.spurt.742 On the colour we just have the very basic things so we have that yeah it channel see a starting from um	223.04	228.39	ES2006d.D.spurt.144 And that's it it with the the black and yellow your even in the right colour	340.57	344.49	ES2006d.C.spurt.208
A: This is the the plan for today's meeting is	31.34	34.64	ES2006a.C.spurt.14 Um	35.13	35.97	ES2006a.C.spurt.15 Um	40.24	40.94	ES2006a.C.spurt.17 although i'm sure you've actually got some of the information already	40.94	44.15	ES2006a.C.spurt.18
B: Channel selection volume selection are absolutely essential and the power	1283.56	1287.08	ES2006b.B.spurt.497 If we can do with it away with that our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say i want to watch a um	1862.24	1870.17	ES2006b.A.spurt.772 Can you how you going to you Stop it from just flipping channels was watching t. v.	1395.13	1400.54	ES2006b.B.spurt.540 So the blue function "'kay" at the bottom	623.88	626.14	ES2006b.C.spurt.237
C: Right and this is the chip that that was talking about last time	124.32	127.3	ES2006c.A.spurt.49 More or less the same structures last time it's a real book or round each of you intend and You can give your presentations on what you've been up to	16.55	25.2	ES2006c.C.spurt.5 Races the time i mean there's a limit to how much the biggest technique and spend fiddling with the t. v.	1665.57	1670.75	ES2006c.B.spurt.812 I see i wasn't completely sure myself but i think it's just like um	906.83	911.07	ES2006c.D.spurt.391
D: Yeah it's a sort of intermediate colour i guess	366.19	368.7	ES2006d.C.spurt.236 Well so you have the colour take a say that a break	563.11	565.86	ES2006d.B.spurt.319 I don't know what special colour means	1162.29	1164.57	ES2006d.C.spurt.661 I don't think uh leds yeah probably so i think this is probably a special colour know	1168.95	1173.2	ES2006d.D.spurt.664
A: But in the main purpose is to say that we get to know each other a little bit more	45.12	49.01	ES2006a.C.spurt.19 Um	50.06	50.62	ES2006a.C.spurt.20 Um	59.19	59.81	ES2006a.C.spurt.22 The the the	62.18	62.56	ES2006a.C.spurt.24
B: "'kay" functional requirements	1098.8	1100.85	ES2006b.B.spurt.413 To the function mm "'kay" you things and it comes up on here	1103.04	1106.16	ES2006b.C.spurt.415 Into the chip	423.72	424.52	ES2006b.A.spurt.162 And the chip then generates the response	437.12	439.44	ES2006b.A.spurt.166
C: uh a sense information to an l. e. d. device yeah	132.87	135.7	ES2006c.A.spurt.52 Yeah bit of a symmetry and stuff but that would be a good way to to get in the whole um	1259.6	1266.09	ES2006c.B.spurt.567 Something a bit squishy and	1283.7	1285.67	ES2006c.C.spurt.579 I don't have too much technical information on here	1488.18	1490.41	ES2006c.A.spurt.703
D: Or or that we have to have some some special colour	1449.45	1452.52	ES2006d.C.spurt.832 Was it it can be yellow us one it can come in the same colour and stuff	1521.08	1524.59	ES2006d.D.spurt.875 Now wait until we get to find them for the most	1012.71	1015.35	ES2006d.C.spurt.610 But that worked well having having a white board that we could draw on as well as having the powerpoint "'cause" that i find that	1675.77	1681.77	ES2006d.C.spurt.981
A: Um then we need to go through uh	64.24	66.77	ES2006a.C.spurt.25 And and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it	70.43	75.47	ES2006a.C.spurt.27 And they and that's it it's so we've got twenty five minutes to do that but until eleven twenty five	76.85	82.59	ES2006a.C.spurt.28 So any Any questions	85.71	87.87	ES2006a.C.spurt.29
B: So the output of the chip Is an infrared	446.91	450.22	ES2006b.A.spurt.169 make the chip More complicated	479.4	481.24	ES2006b.A.spurt.178 That we really think it's important to include video and d. v. d. i could get back to them and see	910.32	914.62	ES2006b.C.spurt.348 And you to twenty five percent um a fashion cent	1174.85	1177.13	ES2006b.B.spurt.438
C: We we don't have too much information about it um	1934.28	1937.09	ES2006c.A.spurt.960 So i'm guessing that the the sample speaker is probably something like a uh and uh you know as soon as you press a button it it now that gives gives you feed that one	535.16	545.44	ES2006c.A.spurt.240 It's it's a way it it's like not separate buttons like this one here but i'm i'm not really sure what they what they you can really turn it around it's like you press this or this or	911.75	921.99	ES2006c.D.spurt.392 A flat fee remote	351.2	352.22	ES2006c.C.spurt.163
D: Thing would like to think the ideas we need we've got no way of finding out	1800.91	1803.81	ES2006d.B.spurt.1062 What what we will have this on the screen on the display	301.49	304.57	ES2006d.D.spurt.177 And we have l. c. display and yeah	1199.79	1202.23	ES2006d.D.spurt.687 Yeah but do we do we have will have l. c. display but the but the wall	1211.24	1214.46	ES2006d.D.spurt.696
A: She	86.49	86.97	ES2006a.A.spurt.30 Look at this point	89.41	90.22	ES2006a.D.spurt.31 Not at this point	90.06	91.04	ES2006a.C.spurt.32 What we're aiming to do Is to create a new	96.95	100.31	ES2006a.C.spurt.34
B: if this is our energy source the the solar cell um	412.05	416.81	ES2006b.A.spurt.159 It communicates Oh it feeds energy	417.29	420.03	ES2006b.A.spurt.160 You do have a new member of energy any because you have like i mean every mayor uh very no has like Call this past and then it cools um	1744.0	1751.75	ES2006b.B.spurt.709 Basically uh	307.17	308.6	ES2006b.A.spurt.122
C: Okay let's keep it option to give an option yeah	1492.65	1494.55	ES2006c.A.spurt.706 Just spinning and not scrolling i would say yeah	1707.19	1709.45	ES2006c.C.spurt.834 Um to be honest actually i mention some uh some other things uh which which could fit and uh and the the stalk	636.5	643.22	ES2006c.D.spurt.284 Mention the more and and	653.23	654.3	ES2006c.D.spurt.290
D: Maybe it's integrated with the l. c. display	1219.48	1221.95	ES2006d.C.spurt.701 Because we keep all the features we keep voice recognition we keep l. c. d. display	1478.33	1482.75	ES2006d.A.spurt.849 I think freeway in you didn't have the whole Pushing the thing "'cause" that wasn't and that's a yeah	1692.82	1698.36	ES2006d.B.spurt.989 It's on the side	265.22	266.06	ES2006d.A.spurt.159
A: Um	103.65	104.47	ES2006a.C.spurt.36 we want it to be something original	104.47	107.56	ES2006a.C.spurt.37 Something trendy and also something user-friendly	108.62	112.59	ES2006a.C.spurt.38 So it has to be quite intuitive that	113.71	115.55	ES2006a.C.spurt.39
B: Basically	483.76	484.25	ES2006b.A.spurt.181 Yeah but and the same time i think maybe we can we can just decided to have well so this group so as our target because actually i mean they all still young people yeah	1711.54	1720.87	ES2006b.D.spurt.695 the one that's allows us to go to the next of the previous channel and then volume has to be there but then the other functionalities um	866.05	874.54	ES2006b.D.spurt.338 Someone's olds t. v. that's blah blah right Be a bit strange to have a fancy right now remote	1674.45	1680.39	ES2006b.C.spurt.674
C: Uh some of them were mentioned already by what to to close	807.44	810.45	ES2006c.D.spurt.348 the the channels and	979.16	980.52	ES2006c.D.spurt.429 So for channel numbers but	1583.21	1584.41	ES2006c.D.spurt.766 Is is that i think the thing is say if someone just want to turn on the t. v. And paul on a channel They they should be easier to use than any of them um i it and then if someone wants to yeah you change the contrast on the t. v. and	1645.65	1660.25	ES2006c.B.spurt.801
D: And seven is no you really doesn't we need to get back and start again	453.13	456.59	ES2006d.B.spurt.272 Yeah i see that we can really each one and like she's are going back to the store and saying oh yeah we did marry speed or i mean are you ready for	470.91	477.65	ES2006d.B.spurt.278 Side flat	703.51	704.6	ES2006d.B.spurt.407 I guess this comes back from this whole be thing links in there	830.59	833.94	ES2006d.B.spurt.477
A: People are able to use this product	116.45	118.16	ES2006a.C.spurt.40 The uh	139.02	139.63	ES2006a.C.spurt.41 Method that we going to use	140.55	143.44	ES2006a.C.spurt.42 To um	144.03	144.84	ES2006a.C.spurt.43
B: Uh and uh from uh the user interface person	274.32	277.64	ES2006b.A.spurt.108 There's a user interface here	429.88	431.72	ES2006b.A.spurt.164 You'll be looking at your be looking at the user interface	2131.99	2134.78	ES2006b.C.spurt.911 have identified a um	228.22	230.34	ES2006b.A.spurt.92
C: We can integrate the um	565.05	566.79	ES2006c.A.spurt.250 The marketing expert has been watching	47.92	49.75	ES2006c.C.spurt.12 You may the hand dynamo into an exercise bike and then you've got exciting was watching t. v.	253.3	257.79	ES2006c.B.spurt.94 As soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it to it it recharges or something	279.45	283.34	ES2006c.A.spurt.116
D: So that we can feed back to the	1565.02	1566.72	ES2006d.C.spurt.902 And then you know you come back three days later didn't get like i really i	1634.04	1639.71	ES2006d.B.spurt.943 Yeah you could take it to taxes than just write stuff down and have it printed out when you go back to the office	1656.73	1661.68	ES2006d.C.spurt.960 It is a beam back it	1712.0	1713.22	ES2006d.B.spurt.1003
A: There is	150.08	150.59	ES2006a.C.spurt.45 Of the uh	154.26	155.17	ES2006a.C.spurt.47 We're going the way we would do that i think is to to work individually initially and then come together	157.42	163.35	ES2006a.C.spurt.49 For meetings to to work on that	163.95	166.24	ES2006a.C.spurt.50
B: Say just a five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more well quite	1369.16	1372.43	ES2006b.B.spurt.529 So i'll put it all put them there as soon as i've written um	2087.04	2089.89	ES2006b.C.spurt.880 i. t. v. button instead of saying that i want to go on channel number forty five	1870.17	1873.99	ES2006b.A.spurt.773 like where ball to find the on off button and maybe the colour	850.84	854.13	ES2006b.D.spurt.331
C: And they can be coloured	317.81	318.91	ES2006c.A.spurt.135 okay i i have a point about l. c. d. i don't know if it is that i went to pick it up	1138.62	1142.45	ES2006c.A.spurt.514 And the colours can be provided with the case rather than	1793.54	1797.44	ES2006c.A.spurt.884 Yeah i think way uh it was a a requirement that we use so um and that the colours of our company so would it be like yellow grey and black or something no	1802.22	1811.15	ES2006c.D.spurt.888
D: Do we have to get back in to be really what we stay in in	1944.66	1947.35	ES2006d.B.spurt.1159 It there's a lot of fun it's like having and then the whole shapes kind of these i would say that it's	200.92	206.16	ES2006d.B.spurt.125 but we which makes it kind of are really	690.14	692.48	ES2006d.A.spurt.396 Uh this this kind of that makes more and and do it might interfere with a i. r. channel	699.35	704.82	ES2006d.A.spurt.403
A: We'll	172.16	172.73	ES2006a.C.spurt.52 Start off by working individually it but their own Expertise on our laptops in a more bring what we've done together	173.13	180.14	ES2006a.C.spurt.53 Um	181.57	182.19	ES2006a.C.spurt.54 Mm	184.65	184.68	ES2006a.B.spurt.56
B: So we've got a parts Ten fifteen minutes To discuss	1502.58	1507.44	ES2006b.C.spurt.580 okay so this is what people find annoying about my controls	1307.08	1309.89	ES2006b.B.spurt.505 Little stations in had thirty minutes more work	2071.43	2074.15	ES2006b.C.spurt.873 I mean is where my from a you know talking about this on the way in c. news wanting us like an idiot of everything i would say yeah say maybe something where you clap and then it beeps and being a kind of summary then often here on the t. v.	1466.97	1480.19	ES2006b.B.spurt.563
C: And putting the options that are are are more manager and lining or something like that	86.99	91.57	ES2006c.A.spurt.34 Five buttons and are we all And for the buttons are in the wheel	2103.69	2107.32	ES2006c.B.spurt.1040 I like the the wheel as the click on the side g. i. numbers know so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff	939.4	945.55	ES2006c.B.spurt.409 So uh the important point a	171.54	173.71	ES2006c.A.spurt.63
D: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern of thing and uh	1179.55	1182.51	ES2006d.D.spurt.670 so what michael will explain you are user interface there	154.1	157.19	ES2006d.A.spurt.94 And we have the user interface	162.49	164.44	ES2006d.A.spurt.98 Well everything else is probably user interface so	173.49	175.78	ES2006d.A.spurt.105
A: Oh	185.04	185.24	ES2006a.C.spurt.57 We called altogether	186.9	187.87	ES2006a.C.spurt.58 Is it just uh	195.1	196.45	ES2006a.A.spurt.60 uh	196.45	196.89	ES2006a.A.spurt.61
B: Of the the the remote control itself	153.07	155.32	ES2006b.C.spurt.63 a remote control	225.97	227.16	ES2006b.A.spurt.90 t. i. z. for the the identification of how the remote control looks and whatever we use parts to it	308.6	313.7	ES2006b.A.spurt.123 But in remote controls uh so mostly just by searching on the web	713.14	718.18	ES2006b.D.spurt.291
C: And uh the marketing things in that Keep the taking out things on this and uh and many things that are important	570.54	577.32	ES2006c.A.spurt.253 Right now the first aspect is the only twice as important as the second aspect	1084.58	1089.02	ES2006c.B.spurt.476 Which twice as important as the third aspect	1089.44	1091.91	ES2006c.B.spurt.478 Important right	1134.06	1135.04	ES2006c.A.spurt.507
D: So at the user interface as as we discussed last time	217.24	220.34	ES2006d.D.spurt.142 Just ball to it you can't really see it in the interface	330.5	332.85	ES2006d.D.spurt.197 Or you could have it so you know on the wheel if you	306.38	309.19	ES2006d.C.spurt.180 So i did wheel it is	1469.29	1470.67	ES2006d.C.spurt.843
A: more detail uh	196.89	198.34	ES2006a.A.spurt.62 lands on it	198.34	199.11	ES2006a.A.spurt.63 You all oh	203.54	204.34	ES2006a.C.spurt.65 Um	205.64	206.29	ES2006a.C.spurt.66
B: it to keep the the the whole remote control small and just like the physical size	839.55	845.48	ES2006b.D.spurt.329 you know a nice looking remote control	1182.84	1184.69	ES2006b.B.spurt.443 current remote controls they don't match the user but maybe well as you see on the next slide	1185.79	1190.87	ES2006b.B.spurt.445 Hmmm remote control	1322.44	1323.76	ES2006b.C.spurt.510
C: And it's a visa be an important feature for clothes shoes and furniture so i i mean i'm taking this to mean you know you could have been s.	1245.52	1253.57	ES2006c.B.spurt.561 The scroll Plus put	421.72	423.61	ES2006c.A.spurt.195 Um with us most number of buttons as one and i would say e. even the appearance of some of them is kind of	779.29	785.22	ES2006c.D.spurt.337 Basically i'll start off by	72.9	75.33	ES2006c.A.spurt.27
D: So it works like a mobile phone flipping but you know as long as that's that's that then that one	709.06	713.93	ES2006d.B.spurt.410 Flip	1811.07	1811.4	ES2006d.C.spurt.1069 mm no we we gonna put that in that sense	300.13	302.46	ES2006d.A.spurt.175 are what i've done on the next page is our setup so we just put them all same	571.7	575.22	ES2006d.B.spurt.323
A: area of things way you will be	206.29	208.04	ES2006a.C.spurt.67 We want to look at	208.97	209.79	ES2006a.C.spurt.68 Right	212.63	213.01	ES2006a.A.spurt.70 Um	218.05	218.58	ES2006a.C.spurt.72
B: and uh remote control might not yeah	1677.85	1679.82	ES2006b.D.spurt.677 Yeah but it but on the other hand remote control isn't it is close to you you probably might just just	1900.7	1906.07	ES2006b.D.spurt.798 Yeah you know a so you have to have the remote control is more like if you lost in used on the safest and you can yeah but it would just change it you can have a list	1920.02	1927.37	ES2006b.B.spurt.805 To the remote control think well i mean it and	1963.84	1965.87	ES2006b.A.spurt.822
C: So um but that's that's basically now now i think that the	561.07	564.64	ES2006c.A.spurt.249 Open	1416.68	1417.31	ES2006c.C.spurt.655 Basically worked out that we're going with that	2034.26	2036.09	ES2006c.C.spurt.1005 And then you open up	2086.96	2087.99	ES2006c.B.spurt.1026
D: That we're gonna put a like we got that there's the locator	726.04	728.42	ES2006d.C.spurt.418 Put fashion in electronics	959.49	961.8	ES2006d.C.spurt.565 You've got the scores can you put that in the project documents file it's in there already	1841.64	1846.48	ES2006d.C.spurt.1094 I There's a vibrate when you press the button	141.71	144.05	ES2006d.C.spurt.87
A: perhaps be given that as an includes the	218.58	221.17	ES2006a.C.spurt.73 How how it will be done	221.65	223.19	ES2006a.A.spurt.74 How people are going to users and and	221.74	224.48	ES2006a.C.spurt.75 So	227.33	228.15	ES2006a.A.spurt.77
B: the fact why it why we want to keep the remote control close to a certain did not to yell at it from the distance	1967.14	1974.42	ES2006b.D.spurt.825 the next meeting um	2152.26	2153.43	ES2006b.D.spurt.924 Yeah more functional it is the answer was already know because of the last need update so uh but for the time being that's that's all you have questions	893.93	902.57	ES2006b.D.spurt.345 it should incorporate it	367.66	369.16	ES2006b.A.spurt.145
C: And at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with so that we can Make a decision on the key remote control concept	27.1	36.09	ES2006c.C.spurt.7 Remote control	102.14	102.9	ES2006c.A.spurt.38 And you mean this would be like b. d. or a shape of the remote control yeah	328.92	333.67	ES2006c.D.spurt.141 Um i like it used to be an walkmans or something there is uh uh i think there's no reason why we can do something like this fall For the remote control	1000.5	1008.72	ES2006c.D.spurt.439
D: And then well this is on off button it's it's quite standard	240.03	243.27	ES2006d.D.spurt.152 Cool all the thing we forgot was like a mute button	295.52	298.37	ES2006d.B.spurt.172 Any button	299.35	300.11	ES2006d.D.spurt.173 l. c. d. and everything so that uh you know my we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway	878.33	882.65	ES2006d.A.spurt.501
A: Um	244.44	245.08	ES2006a.C.spurt.81 i think we'll we'll start	245.08	246.62	ES2006a.C.spurt.82 Okay	249.72	250.02	ES2006a.A.spurt.84 Already but then	249.83	251.14	ES2006a.C.spurt.85
B: also if we can incorporate um	512.89	516.16	ES2006b.A.spurt.190 And yeah and the last question i had to abort whether we wanted to incorporate	888.88	893.32	ES2006b.D.spurt.344 Yeah so if uh if something like that can be incorporated	1874.43	1878.09	ES2006b.A.spurt.778 And then we've got a lunch break	2065.76	2067.07	ES2006b.C.spurt.868
C: okay in that case a remote control really	1557.25	1559.6	ES2006c.D.spurt.750 That is a lot faster than the wheel but you've got a lot less control and uh	951.3	954.26	ES2006c.B.spurt.415 about the spinning wheel so uh i think it	1697.24	1700.31	ES2006c.D.spurt.831 Yeah i think the spinning wheels definitely very now	1779.49	1782.81	ES2006c.B.spurt.875
D: For some buttons	999.89	1000.93	ES2006d.D.spurt.598 Button supplements	1203.22	1204.65	ES2006d.C.spurt.689 If it's a scrolling click so you hold it in	320.31	322.6	ES2006d.C.spurt.190 I mean you can you can use your finger uh to to scroll one and your thumb	640.1	644.17	ES2006d.B.spurt.367
A: Um	262.97	263.63	ES2006a.C.spurt.87 What i'd like us to do now is	264.27	266.53	ES2006a.C.spurt.88 Simultaneously introduce ourselves and	267.66	270.99	ES2006a.C.spurt.89 So it	279.84	280.46	ES2006a.C.spurt.92
B: Before lunch we just have to complete a questionnaire and some sort of summary	2164.01	2167.38	ES2006b.C.spurt.929 So you for lunch	2176.72	2177.63	ES2006b.C.spurt.937 i say really voice recognition is a need to think about	1382.92	1385.81	ES2006b.B.spurt.534 But voice recognition itself i'm not very sure about because one that or uh things like that point about was the uh how do we go about implementing it	1734.75	1742.36	ES2006b.A.spurt.705
C: So the this concerns first first of all the the chips i i should do that uh	449.34	453.21	ES2006c.A.spurt.208 So there's there's a chip be and this one right The um	453.73	457.15	ES2006c.A.spurt.209 Advanced chip	2039.91	2040.83	ES2006c.C.spurt.1008 So i haven't been a powerpoint presentation yeah i i thought values i had	57.7	63.2	ES2006c.A.spurt.19
D: You can have to scroll it straight to roll it straight down uh from you	1369.6	1373.62	ES2006d.C.spurt.784 Mm	0.72	1.02	ES2006d.A.spurt.1 Mm	2.06	2.15	ES2006d.A.spurt.2 Part of it or	2.87	3.54	ES2006d.A.spurt.3
A: Each person into then	281.07	282.62	ES2006a.C.spurt.93 I'd like us to go up to the white board that that panes just underneath it there	283.43	288.34	ES2006a.C.spurt.94 And	289.11	289.84	ES2006a.C.spurt.95 And then tell everyone what	292.81	294.25	ES2006a.C.spurt.97
B: voice recognition software that still quite uh	1757.19	1759.97	ES2006b.A.spurt.718 So that if that was in the the voice recognition that would be great	1877.32	1880.83	ES2006b.C.spurt.780 Voice recognition	2036.85	2038.01	ES2006b.C.spurt.859 working design of this uh	223.75	225.97	ES2006b.A.spurt.89
C: But at the pinhole top	65.11	66.52	ES2006c.C.spurt.23 Our own company has developed a new in user interface Oh wait no this is not the one okay there is uh	814.14	820.81	ES2006c.D.spurt.352 Sorry to speak unit i guess it's it should be	855.25	857.72	ES2006c.D.spurt.370 uh for Coffee the presentation	1026.04	1028.01	ES2006c.B.spurt.451
D: Hmm	3.87	4.24	ES2006d.D.spurt.4 Uh-huh	4.3	4.65	ES2006d.A.spurt.5 Okay	4.75	5.09	ES2006d.C.spurt.6 And	10.84	11.55	ES2006d.C.spurt.8
A: And one you doing dash	297.25	298.46	ES2006a.C.spurt.99 Well i looking at me	306.41	307.75	ES2006a.B.spurt.101 I	307.31	308.3	ES2006a.C.spurt.102 Yeah	307.78	308.12	ES2006a.D.spurt.103
B: um our design should be unique	363.19	364.7	ES2006b.A.spurt.142 I'm hoping that we can keep the keep the design as simple and clear as possible	501.74	505.68	ES2006b.A.spurt.187 design issues then	587.09	588.27	ES2006b.D.spurt.219 Technical specs	1730.19	1731.25	ES2006b.C.spurt.703
C: what we do need to consider how where is the the price is going off in every every such thing that we are considering But since l. c. d. is it seems to be uh a definite yes so um this seems to be one eighty a very would want to spend	1851.93	1864.23	ES2006c.A.spurt.915 No no wait	2015.86	2016.58	ES2006c.C.spurt.1001 Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um	405.02	408.86	ES2006c.A.spurt.186 a scroll wheels	503.31	504.38	ES2006c.A.spurt.227
D: Again all Take minutes to	12.7	15.07	ES2006d.C.spurt.9 Yeah	23.53	23.84	ES2006d.D.spurt.11 So diligently	24.55	26.3	ES2006d.C.spurt.12 Um	27.11	27.62	ES2006d.C.spurt.13
A: I yeah	307.94	309.01	ES2006a.A.spurt.104 yeah	308.12	308.42	ES2006a.D.spurt.105 yeah	308.42	308.55	ES2006a.D.spurt.106 Would you like to go first	311.24	312.49	ES2006a.C.spurt.107
B: but with the tape a bromide it's gonna be quite limited if which saying the main things people want to do is on off	1760.45	1767.31	ES2006b.C.spurt.723 At eighty percent of users would spend more	1177.59	1180.71	ES2006b.B.spurt.439 Seventy six point three percent	1616.16	1618.92	ES2006b.B.spurt.638 Stephen they are seventy six percent of the have more	1620.46	1623.14	ES2006b.A.spurt.643
C: That i'm not sure how one scrolling wheel with what	1724.41	1726.63	ES2006c.B.spurt.844 No no the scroll button is a different think i i have a picture if you	900.14	903.98	ES2006c.D.spurt.388 Shall we try to draw are uh press um	1677.76	1680.85	ES2006c.A.spurt.818 volume and then the rest would be the menu on the screen	982.26	985.42	ES2006c.D.spurt.431
D: It does i'm like cool	27.6	28.85	ES2006d.B.spurt.14 then	27.62	27.88	ES2006d.C.spurt.15 Yeah	29.0	29.87	ES2006d.A.spurt.16 Yeah	29.07	29.95	ES2006d.C.spurt.17
A: And do i have to uh use	312.9	314.21	ES2006a.B.spurt.108 I	313.95	314.68	ES2006a.C.spurt.109 Uh-huh	314.36	315.04	ES2006a.A.spurt.110 Okay	315.81	316.32	ES2006a.B.spurt.111
B: And then of course we going to get anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and people trendy and has the money than out there are still going for this time	1816.61	1825.13	ES2006b.C.spurt.754 So if we go for that the fifteen to thirty five age group	1807.93	1811.44	ES2006b.C.spurt.752 Specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds we want it to look simple	2022.63	2027.82	ES2006b.C.spurt.855 Then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that was sent to the side just saying	92.92	98.34	ES2006b.C.spurt.38
C: Say i mean they'd be easy to use thing is fairly low down	1092.33	1096.06	ES2006c.B.spurt.480 Uh easy yeah	1410.24	1411.31	ES2006c.A.spurt.652 And you go screen	2088.54	2089.51	ES2006c.B.spurt.1027 You have to have a send another flatness i think it it depends on the whole Economic	1362.69	1367.72	ES2006c.B.spurt.632
D: yeah	29.87	30.02	ES2006d.A.spurt.18 yeah i think acts going to	29.95	32.3	ES2006d.C.spurt.19 Then i need to say since Few things about finance "'cause" we have to check that	38.8	43.07	ES2006d.C.spurt.22 It's within the finance	43.76	45.48	ES2006d.C.spurt.23
A: oh well things falling into a wide okay	316.32	319.47	ES2006a.B.spurt.112 Oh	316.85	317.12	ES2006a.C.spurt.113 Yeah	318.34	318.57	ES2006a.C.spurt.114 Put them pockets	319.49	320.33	ES2006a.C.spurt.115
B: email	301.06	301.6	ES2006b.A.spurt.117 Okay so they're them email said that teletext is now	323.25	326.36	ES2006b.A.spurt.127 All the project but it's just at the at this very moment um	704.78	708.95	ES2006b.D.spurt.286 Yeah you share a television or something yeah	1592.99	1595.29	ES2006b.D.spurt.623
C: Flat	1952.9	1953.22	ES2006c.C.spurt.972 An l. c. d.s we can haul c. d. c.	431.79	433.66	ES2006c.A.spurt.199 So now we seem to have a consensus that the l. c. d.s are definitely the way to go because thailand	1218.98	1223.84	ES2006c.A.spurt.542 As l. c. d.s	2009.06	2009.84	ES2006c.A.spurt.997
D: Criteria	46.09	46.93	ES2006d.C.spurt.24 Um	47.88	48.29	ES2006d.C.spurt.25 and then we'll be	48.29	49.6	ES2006d.C.spurt.26 Making sure that	50.61	51.54	ES2006d.C.spurt.27
A: Cool	325.97	326.45	ES2006a.B.spurt.116 You don't have to hurry we've got plenty of time	328.12	330.16	ES2006a.C.spurt.117 Okay	328.21	328.52	ES2006a.B.spurt.118 Say my name's cat And i mean you know very good at this whole going malarkey	331.47	335.68	ES2006a.B.spurt.119
B: Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor	1955.33	1963.15	ES2006b.A.spurt.817 What we have to do now is to go back to our little places complete a questionnaire and some sort of	2051.84	2058.42	ES2006b.C.spurt.866 An email them around	2093.06	2094.3	ES2006b.C.spurt.885 Was the fifteen to twenty five brackets	1579.84	1582.55	ES2006b.C.spurt.614
C: Brief introduction to the insides of uh	99.02	101.32	ES2006c.A.spurt.37 If you flip	136.25	136.98	ES2006c.A.spurt.54 Okay a apparently a place and vegetables will be for writing inspiration so i i discovered to follow up	1238.0	1243.33	ES2006c.B.spurt.557 We don't want that that's no that's not not vegetable uh-huh	1498.98	1502.4	ES2006c.C.spurt.710
D: Financial limit	56.33	57.75	ES2006d.C.spurt.29 Um	58.72	59.31	ES2006d.C.spurt.30 And then then we get to make the right one	68.61	70.53	ES2006d.B.spurt.33 Yeah	70.96	71.64	ES2006d.C.spurt.34
A: Yeah	335.38	335.75	ES2006a.C.spurt.120 yeah	335.75	336.06	ES2006a.C.spurt.121 yeah	336.06	336.2	ES2006a.C.spurt.122 Say	336.13	336.7	ES2006a.B.spurt.123
B: It's more that twenty five to thirty five when people are really making us and i've got their first job and i want then asked always and	1594.84	1600.68	ES2006b.C.spurt.625 people would think twenty five to thirty five	1612.51	1614.61	ES2006b.A.spurt.636 So with that i think specify hand over to you does anyone have a preference for	156.97	161.77	ES2006b.C.spurt.64 it in my personal preferences um	498.06	500.18	ES2006b.A.spurt.185
C: That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme there	1811.89	1814.5	ES2006c.B.spurt.890 That so it's flipped	1953.82	1955.05	ES2006c.C.spurt.973 It can be curved	310.21	311.31	ES2006c.A.spurt.130 So probably double curved surface is the way to go	1346.06	1348.39	ES2006c.A.spurt.623
D: Uh-huh	71.36	72.03	ES2006d.D.spurt.35 Uh-huh	71.53	72.27	ES2006d.A.spurt.36 yeah	71.64	71.8	ES2006d.C.spurt.37 Because we we nice to know	72.62	73.97	ES2006d.C.spurt.38
A: Um mm yeah	337.25	338.17	ES2006a.B.spurt.124 Okay	350.91	351.47	ES2006a.B.spurt.125 Uh-huh	351.82	352.3	ES2006a.D.spurt.126 okay	352.3	352.88	ES2006a.D.spurt.127
B: And you could change things on the screen then	877.71	879.93	ES2006b.D.spurt.340 Personal preferences	1408.67	1409.66	ES2006b.B.spurt.546 Whistle on the screen is that you yeah	1465.88	1468.55	ES2006b.C.spurt.562 we're better off targeting a younger audience and um	1541.62	1545.1	ES2006b.A.spurt.596
C: Everything else is kind of	142.49	143.75	ES2006c.A.spurt.56 The third one is the A kind of taken that you on this	249.02	252.42	ES2006c.A.spurt.93 Uh there were different kind of supplements available um	339.63	342.66	ES2006c.A.spurt.150 some space design equipment So it's kind of um	366.99	370.53	ES2006c.A.spurt.173
D: Yeah	74.51	75.14	ES2006d.B.spurt.39 So	75.93	76.7	ES2006d.C.spurt.40 It's now i guess that was the start it	77.69	80.27	ES2006d.C.spurt.41 In thirty five	80.71	81.67	ES2006d.C.spurt.42
A: Yeah	352.65	353.11	ES2006a.A.spurt.128 Scott now is	352.75	353.88	ES2006a.C.spurt.129 Oh good point	354.44	355.36	ES2006a.B.spurt.130 All ties always within that Right okay	356.79	359.16	ES2006a.B.spurt.131
B: Usually know like power and all those things	1637.63	1639.92	ES2006b.C.spurt.648 "'kay"	799.63	800.2	ES2006b.D.spurt.319 Okay what i can send it only	1222.49	1224.23	ES2006b.B.spurt.463 I think as far as them more call for companies can send if you want to have things to be and uh	1533.75	1539.59	ES2006b.A.spurt.593
C: So is the ipod the kind of uh	921.27	923.28	ES2006c.A.spurt.396 Yeah well energy source	1332.05	1333.33	ES2006c.A.spurt.606 So we discounting solar energy beaches well there's gonna be used in the somewhere or	1868.84	1873.86	ES2006c.B.spurt.919 Rubber buttons but then	1748.35	1749.54	ES2006c.D.spurt.860
D: So we've got and so	82.1	83.25	ES2006d.C.spurt.43 Four	83.65	84.22	ES2006d.C.spurt.44 Jane	86.38	86.86	ES2006d.C.spurt.45 No How how much do we have forty minutes	88.0	90.79	ES2006d.A.spurt.46
A: what uh oh sorry	359.16	360.44	ES2006a.B.spurt.132 Okay	369.65	370.38	ES2006a.B.spurt.133 cool	370.38	370.81	ES2006a.B.spurt.134 Um	371.68	372.41	ES2006a.B.spurt.135
B: I think if you watch t. f. t. v. to get the best a strain injury from um	1318.21	1322.08	ES2006b.B.spurt.508 In a watching t. v. that's a list of you problem but hynek	1322.91	1326.4	ES2006b.B.spurt.511 Yeah the last minute yeah	97.81	99.52	ES2006b.D.spurt.39 At the last minute i'm sorry about that but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing	98.91	104.26	ES2006b.C.spurt.40
C: one sided	313.95	314.7	ES2006c.A.spurt.133 On both sides	320.37	321.39	ES2006c.A.spurt.137 And you know you could have two sides mean it's the whole thing is just to be coming that thing	1392.8	1397.42	ES2006c.B.spurt.647 That would be on one side uh huh	1737.84	1739.71	ES2006c.C.spurt.850
D: Right	89.0	89.29	ES2006d.C.spurt.47 Yeah well for fifteen yeah	90.44	91.88	ES2006d.D.spurt.48 Yeah	90.91	91.49	ES2006d.C.spurt.49 Yeah	91.16	91.52	ES2006d.B.spurt.50
A: this is a rabbit	372.41	373.2	ES2006a.B.spurt.136 Yeah	374.28	374.43	ES2006a.D.spurt.137 I	374.54	375.52	ES2006a.A.spurt.138 I	374.63	375.12	ES2006a.B.spurt.139
B: And we've got forty minutes to do that in	125.79	127.83	ES2006b.C.spurt.49 Yeah i thought was last minute things you can make use of west	598.12	601.23	ES2006b.C.spurt.226 are we going to have it in and right soft line short michelle we prepare a web	2153.43	2157.77	ES2006b.D.spurt.925 To prepare okay	2160.13	2161.33	ES2006b.D.spurt.927
C: You haven't made a powerpoint okay	59.98	61.26	ES2006c.C.spurt.20 i thought i'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options And what we can do is that we can start uh	76.58	82.54	ES2006c.A.spurt.29 rubbing off the options that we do not require	84.15	86.58	ES2006c.A.spurt.32 That's it for twenty or so these are the different options that we have	192.63	196.17	ES2006c.A.spurt.68
D: until about four fifteen so	91.49	93.67	ES2006d.C.spurt.51 Okay	96.83	97.34	ES2006d.A.spurt.52 Therefore do you want	97.32	98.17	ES2006d.C.spurt.53 so	97.34	97.83	ES2006d.A.spurt.54
A: I thought it might be a cat	374.65	375.74	ES2006a.C.spurt.140 Yeah well or is it at at first i thought it was going to be kept it	375.47	378.98	ES2006a.D.spurt.141 I	378.6	379.24	ES2006a.A.spurt.142 Yeah i i really is very not so make it look you have a	379.13	382.0	ES2006a.B.spurt.143
B: Well that's a bit difficult to say	1216.67	1218.04	ES2006b.C.spurt.460 What you can't see is volume selection to little bit higher than all the others	1251.87	1255.14	ES2006b.B.spurt.483 A bit cool	1417.57	1418.16	ES2006b.B.spurt.549 Um but that obviously need to little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems were mentioning	2040.88	2047.82	ES2006b.C.spurt.863
C: I don't know if even if you want to consider this but the uh the different things that the company make so the the they'll they'll since other comment only from the company really uh cheaper all these options	236.86	246.78	ES2006c.A.spurt.89 It's a good option	263.98	264.73	ES2006c.A.spurt.105 And the fourth option is the Solar cells	284.39	287.51	ES2006c.A.spurt.118 Which are also i have made the company and lemon friendly	288.02	291.44	ES2006c.A.spurt.120
D: So is that um	98.71	99.78	ES2006d.D.spurt.55 Oh are we starting with the the	100.38	102.19	ES2006d.D.spurt.56 Yes	101.56	102.14	ES2006d.C.spurt.57 Wasn't it	102.18	102.61	ES2006d.A.spurt.58
A: Yeah and i know ions and uh yeah	380.88	382.7	ES2006a.D.spurt.144 Yeah	383.13	383.24	ES2006a.C.spurt.145 Uh	383.47	383.7	ES2006a.D.spurt.146 huh huh	383.7	384.06	ES2006a.D.spurt.147
B: But it would certainly be more popular with as it yet but the younger people as compared to Or or people yeah	1570.77	1575.84	ES2006b.A.spurt.610 Where it was most popular	1577.94	1579.34	ES2006b.C.spurt.613 Ah how popular was that	1615.01	1616.67	ES2006b.A.spurt.637 So it was still still still quite popular amongst them	1617.35	1620.05	ES2006b.A.spurt.640
C: These are the three options	325.17	326.26	ES2006c.A.spurt.139 okay the interface options now	390.71	392.06	ES2006c.A.spurt.182 The base electronic options are	440.36	442.03	ES2006c.A.spurt.205 so that's spinning	959.46	960.81	ES2006c.A.spurt.421
D: So we you maybe start was like the in the shape and things and	102.83	106.96	ES2006d.D.spurt.59 Okay	111.41	111.8	ES2006d.A.spurt.61 Okay	113.79	114.56	ES2006d.A.spurt.62 so uh	114.56	116.14	ES2006d.A.spurt.63
A: I can see but ideas	383.87	385.16	ES2006a.C.spurt.148 Yeah	385.47	385.85	ES2006a.D.spurt.149 Okay	386.11	386.63	ES2006a.B.spurt.150 right it's a fluffy rubber	386.63	387.91	ES2006a.B.spurt.151
B: Switch the channel um	764.38	766.53	ES2006b.D.spurt.305 The channel numbers and then uh um	863.6	866.05	ES2006b.D.spurt.337 It's um switching between channels sort of	1193.65	1196.14	ES2006b.C.spurt.447 And what you couldn't really see from that is the thing that she's mouse is the channel selection	1246.47	1251.25	ES2006b.B.spurt.481
C: Or maybe the l. c. d. and spinning	1135.73	1137.58	ES2006c.C.spurt.509 because i mean if you think most people use the main control with the wind up Right and see you wanna	1268.49	1273.85	ES2006c.B.spurt.570 Okay we still have all all the options aboard be think would will be a good idea	1506.74	1511.21	ES2006c.A.spurt.715 it seems to be made out of try and you know and and nobody seems to be	1571.72	1575.49	ES2006c.A.spurt.757
D: Uh-huh	119.59	120.12	ES2006d.D.spurt.65 And approximate shape of a banana	121.79	123.89	ES2006d.A.spurt.66 Uh-huh	124.54	124.97	ES2006d.C.spurt.67 I	124.96	125.41	ES2006d.A.spurt.68
A: They've got this thing come in blue that unit	388.83	390.97	ES2006a.B.spurt.152 Um	391.49	391.84	ES2006a.B.spurt.153 okay and i like it because it's small	391.84	393.67	ES2006a.B.spurt.154 No	394.53	394.94	ES2006a.A.spurt.155
B: Channel five	1767.82	1768.96	ES2006b.C.spurt.725 so the findings uh where am	747.0	748.69	ES2006b.D.spurt.302 Did you find it it's just yeah	2089.3	2091.03	ES2006b.D.spurt.881 I guess i'll find out	2130.86	2131.71	ES2006b.A.spurt.910
C: made it a problem And	2048.2	2050.52	ES2006c.C.spurt.1012 Like you said know the scroll	897.76	899.48	ES2006c.C.spurt.384 Yeah if you look if you Scrolling through the a to z. v. music any looking for something it t. v.	946.27	950.78	ES2006c.B.spurt.412 what about the the scrolling uh	1689.54	1691.81	ES2006c.A.spurt.828
D: i	124.97	125.67	ES2006d.C.spurt.69 Okay	125.14	125.25	ES2006d.B.spurt.70 Um	126.7	127.37	ES2006d.A.spurt.71 You think we're not as as a thing to use of it	126.78	129.17	ES2006d.B.spurt.72
A: And it's left a	395.18	396.18	ES2006a.B.spurt.156 Uh-huh	397.08	397.44	ES2006a.D.spurt.157 And one day you be able to just a genetically modified um and i will come in think	397.96	402.23	ES2006a.B.spurt.158 Oh ha ha	402.72	403.5	ES2006a.D.spurt.159
B: Look at the functions	150.03	151.16	ES2006b.C.spurt.61 Oh and have you You need to then also the press when you lost Function f. eight	616.64	622.75	ES2006b.C.spurt.235 Oh if you press it if you press function and that again there's there's usually three no it's one where it's only here one where it's only there um on where it's both	653.41	661.89	ES2006b.C.spurt.259 functionality they used	720.48	721.74	ES2006b.D.spurt.293
C: That's over on the interface if you could put uh-huh	1127.7	1130.73	ES2006c.C.spurt.502 I think that's what you guys are gonna doing next so if we put an i. k. e.	1680.55	1685.12	ES2006c.C.spurt.819 Then i put the mean but if it's	1933.42	1934.96	ES2006c.C.spurt.959 so what what you see i. is the this is the outside of the remote right	113.63	119.13	ES2006c.A.spurt.44
D: mm	127.37	127.52	ES2006d.A.spurt.73 Chronic	129.78	130.39	ES2006d.B.spurt.74 Okay	130.78	131.41	ES2006d.A.spurt.75 Uh-huh	131.16	131.54	ES2006d.D.spurt.76
A: Yeah	402.74	403.38	ES2006a.A.spurt.160 Yeah	402.88	403.04	ES2006a.C.spurt.161 yeah	403.38	403.72	ES2006a.A.spurt.162 Okay	404.72	405.04	ES2006a.B.spurt.163
B: functionality is	811.31	812.28	ES2006b.D.spurt.322 we do not want to have all this complicated functions at it to our	830.97	835.09	ES2006b.D.spurt.327 for example brightness and and similar and functions could be just um	880.93	886.4	ES2006b.D.spurt.342 Um you know a functional say is useful but minimalist	1418.75	1423.13	ES2006b.B.spurt.550
C: And charging the remote	258.01	259.24	ES2006c.C.spurt.95 The remote "'cause" you	276.22	276.98	ES2006c.C.spurt.113 We can have pushbuttons like most remotes to	396.47	399.06	ES2006c.A.spurt.184 So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the B. c. b.	148.86	154.12	ES2006c.A.spurt.60
D: Um	132.13	132.94	ES2006d.A.spurt.77 Well but it's it's just not approximation uh-huh	132.52	135.44	ES2006d.D.spurt.78 Do you expect it yeah	133.8	135.24	ES2006d.C.spurt.79 Yeah	134.89	135.23	ES2006d.A.spurt.80
A: Ah right um	407.48	408.45	ES2006a.B.spurt.165 be um and in the middle	408.45	410.1	ES2006a.B.spurt.166 Well	411.09	411.28	ES2006a.B.spurt.167 Top and the key okay cool i'm the marketing expert	414.32	418.26	ES2006a.B.spurt.168
B: It might not even function with the l. t. v.	1680.38	1682.44	ES2006b.D.spurt.678 But is everyone's could functional requirements	2103.51	2105.75	ES2006b.B.spurt.892 i just quickly to put them down	302.46	304.24	ES2006b.A.spurt.119 Well so uh so we'll just put them in their way way we yeah well we won't even okay	2098.94	2102.87	ES2006b.D.spurt.889
C: Some in in the case so many user interface is there just so full of buttons that it's actually	726.38	731.79	ES2006c.D.spurt.320 So yeah that might be you can have many many buttons actually it all that all all these i personally prefer this one because it's it's the smallest and and with with least	768.62	778.61	ES2006c.D.spurt.336 So to have the standards a major buttons like on off um	974.41	979.16	ES2006c.D.spurt.427 i what Say buttons because it's yeah	1642.27	1645.17	ES2006c.D.spurt.798
D: uh-huh	135.44	135.68	ES2006d.D.spurt.81 Do we expect that to	136.01	137.2	ES2006d.C.spurt.82 Yeah	137.57	137.63	ES2006d.A.spurt.83 Uh-huh	137.81	138.3	ES2006d.D.spurt.84

D: So it as we can see that's way too expensive to hand yeah	1267.6	1271.67	ES2006d.C.spurt.727 What what what's our take it yeah	1271.45	1273.25	ES2006d.A.spurt.728 This sample sensor uh	1272.03	1273.78	ES2006d.B.spurt.729 Our budget Twelve point five	1272.83	1275.72	ES2006d.C.spurt.730
B: Right	1770.15	1770.58	ES2006b.A.spurt.728 Loud are that that should be relatively simple	1770.91	1774.07	ES2006b.C.spurt.729 Say	1771.74	1772.28	ES2006b.B.spurt.730 Okay all	1773.97	1774.58	ES2006b.A.spurt.731
C: Is that the practicality really is in a in a i mean if	1473.75	1476.87	ES2006c.B.spurt.695 It's	1473.87	1474.25	ES2006c.A.spurt.696 Mm yeah	1475.21	1475.96	ES2006c.A.spurt.697 Maybe frustrating for the user	1481.95	1483.6	ES2006c.A.spurt.699
D: Um	1275.39	1275.78	ES2006d.A.spurt.731 Yeah	1275.73	1276.18	ES2006d.B.spurt.732 okay	1275.78	1276.1	ES2006d.A.spurt.733 the sample sensor will have to go a "'cause" that's the most expensive thing on the	1276.18	1279.34	ES2006d.B.spurt.734
B: Right	1776.58	1776.95	ES2006b.A.spurt.733 Yeah	1786.03	1786.46	ES2006b.C.spurt.734 Mm	1786.73	1787.1	ES2006b.A.spurt.735 Yeah	1789.34	1789.91	ES2006b.C.spurt.737
C: Depends how much how much	1483.73	1485.52	ES2006c.C.spurt.700 Movement it really names	1486.1	1487.58	ES2006c.C.spurt.701 But presumably if they're suggesting it then	1488.39	1491.02	ES2006c.C.spurt.704 We could use it	1491.44	1492.08	ES2006c.C.spurt.705
D: Yeah	1278.92	1279.26	ES2006d.C.spurt.735 So	1279.86	1280.14	ES2006d.C.spurt.736 That has implications for for d.	1280.84	1283.88	ES2006d.C.spurt.737 Yeah it does not have for voice recognition where does have for the feedback speaker Then when you say when you press one it says one uh or it says hollow	1284.29	1292.89	ES2006d.A.spurt.738
B: yeah	1789.91	1790.11	ES2006b.C.spurt.738 That like say you just say we might five You know you might	1790.05	1794.04	ES2006b.B.spurt.739 Right	1793.52	1793.84	ES2006b.A.spurt.740 Ten	1794.74	1795.19	ES2006b.B.spurt.741

D: And the locator also go away	1295.48	1297.08	ES2006d.A.spurt.744 But it was a very not innovative and then	1297.01	1299.96	ES2006d.D.spurt.745 Yeah	1299.38	1299.83	ES2006d.C.spurt.746 In a way innovativeness well there	1300.38	1302.21	ES2006d.D.spurt.747
B: so it seems like the the feasible thing to implement	1798.58	1801.4	ES2006b.A.spurt.746 Yeah	1798.95	1799.32	ES2006b.D.spurt.747 Yeah but maybe you wanna look into that just to just to check	1801.64	1805.25	ES2006b.C.spurt.748 Uh	1802.04	1802.64	ES2006b.A.spurt.749
