A: here's our project We're gonna make a new remote control 71.63 74.77 ES2010a.A.spurt.26
B: Method of our design i i think i just a realistic that some of the things that we actually need to put into this we need a power source for gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multifunctional 718.96 728.64 ES2010b.B.spurt.263
C: Um a certain restrictions to apply here though uh wait x. t. k. do solar power with a latex one so if they want so what i saw squishy rubber or they can't have the solar powered option 720.78 731.29 ES2010c.B.spurt.264
D: Additional signals on the side so was i gonna be an extra one on each side is No that is is is that should use it for our story because of what each side one on top i mean it's fine it's it just comes up the same as twenty nine what was happening okay 615.29 631.49 ES2010d.D.spurt.310
A: Our first ideas about this new remote anything that you can bring to the table for this project 418.8 423.44 ES2010a.A.spurt.153
B: well in the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device to if we said find remote looking remote or something 1397.85 1405.42 ES2010b.A.spurt.536
C: With the power source nurse the circuit Chip senses the connection to produces morse code infrared signal 591.03 597.48 ES2010c.B.spurt.231
D: And then on the side you have the buttons 102.32 104.19 ES2010d.C.spurt.54
A: The technical fun functions design making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do the functionality of it Operating all those different things 601.98 609.24 ES2010a.A.spurt.254
B: extra functions will probably need an additional chip Either that or the smart chip will have to be 730.47 736.3 ES2010b.B.spurt.265
C: They suggested power options solar cells hand dynamo In kinetic power so you shake it and in creases the power 686.43 694.45 ES2010c.B.spurt.251
D: it's it's it's so it's it's the opposite side but it's it's it's yeah 570.61 578.6 ES2010d.D.spurt.285
A: To get a pretty good habitat in a pretty sometimes sometimes vicious but that's okay 261.74 266.47 ES2010a.D.spurt.72
B: i'm gonna put the minutes i put them as for the first mean already in the project documents folder if you'd like to review them and i'm gonna take up minutes for this one as well 1717.56 1724.33 ES2010b.A.spurt.653
C: contact disks for the buttons plastic for the casing and a Power source whatever power source we've actually to turn and we want 648.6 655.91 ES2010c.B.spurt.242
D: What actually wanting to what we want to tell them and one for this one each for each side of it 589.14 595.43 ES2010d.D.spurt.296
A: i'm andy and i'm the project manager and i know my name's again courtney 26.68 31.44 ES2010a.A.spurt.9
B: Users might chip is just a chip that's been programmed in designed so that it can be complete Of fair range of functions 741.45 749.26 ES2010b.B.spurt.268
C: Like this We're we put the buttons around like we put a big on off button or something else um no i mean it could be the arrows are red or for for channel up and down and then put the numbers around in like it will fashion dial shape 240.66 251.88 ES2010c.D.spurt.106
D: A scroll on the side it's a push button 597.1 598.92 ES2010d.B.spurt.299
A: a tool training We're going to oh i guess figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles 57.75 64.35 ES2010a.A.spurt.23
B: Gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control and then gonna close the meeting 114.08 118.86 ES2010b.A.spurt.49
C: Specific to that button So you press the button a produces a a signal it's encoded specifically for that button 597.96 604.71 ES2010c.B.spurt.232
D: So these are the creek here we're gonna ask is it easy to use it fashionable 213.52 217.93 ES2010d.D.spurt.117
A: Um we make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close the meeting 64.73 69.11 ES2010a.A.spurt.24
B: But they'll the role of secretary take the meeting minutes And we're gonna have three presentations one from each of you Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements 103.97 112.39 ES2010b.A.spurt.47
C: we're now for options for casing such as straight curved double curved You know very specific to the customer 704.79 710.66 ES2010c.B.spurt.256
D: fashionable 314.06 314.82 ES2010d.D.spurt.155
A: Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to 104.66 108.14 ES2010a.A.spurt.34
B: Well then then they put the voice recognition d. put there like receiver on the actual television In the base or in the actual remote "'cause" then you've already got them and then hand wages can speak to the remote 1381.04 1391.5 ES2010b.C.spurt.532
C: Double curved he can't do titanium um that would be to curvature so would actually if you the shape of your hand you curve here in you curve here 731.76 741.02 ES2010c.B.spurt.265
D: Yeah but you know i mean like an l. i think it's very fashionable she 316.02 320.26 ES2010d.D.spurt.156
A: Um for our new product that we're gonna be designing 22.94 25.32 ES2010a.A.spurt.7
B: welcome to our second meeting this is the functional design meeting 87.05 90.71 ES2010b.A.spurt.42
C: You say at the bottom is kind of difficult c. b. have like a sort of Division between the bottom like where the logo is and if we have a replaceable section it's like the top 1653.52 1662.63 ES2010c.C.spurt.730
D: Then an a fashion 337.35 338.33 ES2010d.C.spurt.169
A: We're gonna have to discuss the functional design first 90.03 92.63 ES2010a.A.spurt.30
B: i i think we can make a decision on that later out will still put that as a point do we need to discuss so that would include battery source 1308.04 1314.9 ES2010b.A.spurt.503
C: Either that or just have it by shape for example you have a specific triangular shape it you know you're looking at the up and down a row and the round once it's sort of feel by you know the third one down a sort of things that sort of looking into 442.73 454.28 ES2010c.C.spurt.172
D: Have technologically advanced should be and a half fashionable 747.33 750.33 ES2010d.A.spurt.380
A: Same thing with conceptual design 102.09 103.86 ES2010a.A.spurt.33
B: The thing sits black they all the different age groups have different designs for speech recognition 1354.64 1359.92 ES2010b.D.spurt.520
C: Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the t. v.s sender which interprets a signal responds accordingly changes channel et cetera 605.28 612.92 ES2010c.B.spurt.233
D: And more fashion forward and you can 751.71 753.7 ES2010d.D.spurt.383
A: And then the detailed design just more in depth get the actual Schematics of the 113.74 119.05 ES2010a.A.spurt.36
B: Yeah "'cause" we need to we definitely need have buttons for like subtitles and things like that is because the foreign film market is expanding and stuff and Like on television like i know for a living in los angeles It's time the spanish network television if it has 1603.46 1618.19 ES2010b.D.spurt.612
C: that we need of real reaction mother colour scheme obviously that's one of work he calls or rubber product and i was thinking about different times a designs and i came up or something 224.43 233.62 ES2010c.D.spurt.103
D: Logically and that's you right brain taken over what one in the artistic the fashionable the hip 848.66 854.31 ES2010d.A.spurt.433
A: That the design of the product how it feels in your hand 489.62 492.53 ES2010a.A.spurt.192
B: Um power source i figured batteries "'cause" 770.3 773.42 ES2010b.B.spurt.278
C: We need rubber for buttons uh well known for battery contacts integrated circuit which consists of a diode transistor resonator resistors and a capacitor 626.05 635.4 ES2010c.B.spurt.236
D: I went to school that's old fashioned to me 869.29 871.23 ES2010d.C.spurt.447
A: You're going to think about the working design uh-huh 588.65 591.62 ES2010a.A.spurt.247
B: Well even if we kept the regular standard size of remote if we reduce the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra "'cause" are saying they only use ten percent of them 1107.26 1118.09 ES2010b.B.spurt.414
C: All those basic things that make a circuit function 635.84 638.3 ES2010c.B.spurt.237
D: Fashion a bit more pilots oh i will probably be a desire for sure you know he's it's not a problem with 917.35 927.76 ES2010d.D.spurt.474
A: Do individual work me that's pretty much the the whole process for today 109.18 113.0 ES2010a.A.spurt.35
B: You are already audio settings and screen settings we need those like audio settings mono stereo pitch screen settings like brightness colour or do we just want that excess Access from the television itself 1574.33 1586.12 ES2010b.D.spurt.607
C: uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power 1169.24 1171.8 ES2010c.B.spurt.478
D: I try i found out or just 8.09 9.9 ES2010d.D.spurt.1
A: You know they're all wanna vascular system think it's pretty cool yeah 256.75 260.48 ES2010a.D.spurt.69
B: Well if you have a base You start putting a charger and then you have a different kind of battery 1295.89 1299.99 ES2010b.C.spurt.497
C: Okay i kinda brings us to this looks but if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost 948.13 954.5 ES2010c.A.spurt.365
D: Oh i 11.15 11.89 ES2010d.D.spurt.2
A: It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat 279.75 281.65 ES2010a.B.spurt.80
B: Of the users are not technically happy with current remote controls seventy five percent think they're ugly 425.29 430.96 ES2010b.D.spurt.137
C: And then on the right you have what's really big trend right now is the ipod's becoming really fast thing and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu Section 369.66 380.15 ES2010c.C.spurt.149
D: Oh oh no 13.54 15.09 ES2010d.D.spurt.3
A: they pretty much know what they want to get it 288.97 290.71 ES2010a.B.spurt.89
B: And then lastly we're going to that and then it's working design How exactly will perform its functions that's the whole technical side of 151.7 159.07 ES2010b.A.spurt.57
C: In addition to that in for our for and all those different options to the customer for producing their remote 788.73 794.46 ES2010c.B.spurt.284
D: Uh-huh 18.93 19.44 ES2010d.D.spurt.4
A: yeah if you're running from one pretty time 306.5 308.32 ES2010a.D.spurt.103
B: People will say that they typically was as you saw for now because probably those remote control the time much like any small pointer cellphone 504.79 512.57 ES2010b.D.spurt.177
C: It's a cute we call it changed to yellow bright yellow for like a But for the company logo 467.88 473.64 ES2010c.C.spurt.183
D: looking at 19.44 19.94 ES2010d.D.spurt.5
A: Remote 119.62 120.07 ES2010a.A.spurt.37
B: But it also is so the channel the volume and the power buttons are most important 559.07 564.05 ES2010b.D.spurt.200
C: Findings wheel which where the required materials for the basic internal construction so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed 617.18 625.43 ES2010c.B.spurt.235
D: Okay 19.53 19.95 ES2010d.A.spurt.6
A: The selling price for our remote is going to be twenty five euro 380.54 384.27 ES2010a.A.spurt.145
B: Or this channel go to channel nine ten volume up etcetera 241.48 244.63 ES2010b.C.spurt.88
C: Um if we find another company you can produce the required chips 666.88 670.27 ES2010c.B.spurt.245
D: Ah yes yes yes or no it's uh 20.93 24.32 ES2010d.D.spurt.7
A: I production cost to make that profit is gonna be max of twelve fifty euro per remote 397.02 402.62 ES2010a.A.spurt.149
B: And you have a mute button and the numbers need that The power buttons like to see two different had the more complex and more simple version 339.49 346.33 ES2010b.C.spurt.113
C: I think we'd have to decide on the power options maybe So the we could reduce cost 941.6 946.62 ES2010c.B.spurt.361
D: Um here's the agenda 20.97 22.25 ES2010d.A.spurt.8
A: hear some topics that we might be able discuss expect our experiences with remote controls um 412.71 418.39 ES2010a.A.spurt.152
B: They we need something simple because most people all thirty four percent Say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one and we don't wanna do we wanna very too far from the normal 514.81 525.67 ES2010b.D.spurt.179
C: Casing l. e. d. any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate then we are cells are producing we should go for 670.8 677.82 ES2010c.B.spurt.246
D: Um 23.83 24.64 ES2010d.A.spurt.9
A: Well we wanna make a multifunctional remote way 430.99 433.35 ES2010a.B.spurt.159
B: Yeah it's like black black and white kind of 1007.41 1009.65 ES2010b.C.spurt.370
C: The menu button i don't know but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get 1535.81 1541.19 ES2010c.A.spurt.675
D: Yeah we have a presentation i'm going to discuss you know it's it's yeah 25.98 32.55 ES2010d.D.spurt.10
A: One remote for everything 433.86 435.1 ES2010a.B.spurt.161
B: Mine meeting minutes 1208.95 1210.01 ES2010b.A.spurt.453
C: Options for materials plastic rubber titanium wood 711.16 714.32 ES2010c.B.spurt.257
D: The opening we're going to have a 26.01 27.36 ES2010d.A.spurt.11
A: It needs to be compatible "'cause" universal remote controls are never universal 454.99 458.47 ES2010a.D.spurt.177
B: I think we should definitely go with buttons they don't look like a normal remote "'cause" most remotes have small square buttons i think we should do something like Maybe big earn round like bowls 925.0 933.52 ES2010b.D.spurt.342
C: Um personal preferences uh to save money for the components the remote should be mass produced in basic material should be but on that as 658.97 666.48 ES2010c.B.spurt.244
D: Mm case and then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria 28.31 32.24 ES2010d.A.spurt.12
A: Oh we need insanely good instruction booklet because you always have to reconfigure all your Interactions to go with remote anyways 475.47 482.38 ES2010a.D.spurt.188
B: Although we could if we had a speech recognition and we can start naming it as like a another kind of more handicapped 1331.68 1336.72 ES2010b.C.spurt.510
C: They have to versus functional and then it has to also be technologically innovative and yet easy to use so because we're basically is confusions they don't know exactly what they what they want us to tell them 129.33 141.86 ES2010c.D.spurt.70
D: it's a it's a 32.55 34.32 ES2010d.D.spurt.13
A: Anybody have any experiences with remote control that they can remember that 520.35 523.52 ES2010a.A.spurt.208
B: Oh finding kind of device or I'll think of a 1254.43 1258.24 ES2010b.A.spurt.473
C: it's sense we do put the fashion in electronics it is kind of important how what our product box so i guess we know hiding 103.95 110.55 ES2010c.D.spurt.65
D: Our remote 34.19 34.87 ES2010d.A.spurt.14
A: So the start writing on here do you have to start by pressing anything on this page okay 5.61 10.09 ES2010a.A.spurt.1
B: Yeah so you don't have to stay right that in for right "'cause" you know when the battery start sign in your remote currently you have to actually stay right that bulb and go okay 873.26 881.54 ES2010b.B.spurt.317
C: You know you're in the dark you know wanna be looking at your remote control and the picture particularly is point yeah if you look at the top volume button 410.54 418.27 ES2010c.C.spurt.162
D: Then we're going to evaluate though 35.36 37.27 ES2010d.A.spurt.15
A: Well my folder but as 11.61 13.17 ES2010a.D.spurt.2
B: What exactly is a smart chip 739.72 741.14 ES2010b.D.spurt.267
C: Yeah like using the menu to be like in your name into the screen like on the menu options of the way there 885.07 890.45 ES2010c.D.spurt.331
D: Right right we know that and that's right that's that is 35.6 42.04 ES2010d.D.spurt.16
A: Meter 13.26 13.84 ES2010a.A.spurt.3
B: Um smart chip that preferred so that permits sorry 807.92 811.28 ES2010b.B.spurt.288
C: I'd double curved in rubber um 799.18 802.56 ES2010c.B.spurt.286
D: The whole production process and then when to close that we have forty minutes so 38.61 42.21 ES2010d.A.spurt.17
A: That's cool 13.81 14.56 ES2010a.D.spurt.4
B: Power source 827.94 829.0 ES2010b.B.spurt.295
C: After this meeting a team or reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control 64.29 68.13 ES2010c.A.spurt.42
D: Sorry oh no but i'm project presentation 43.82 46.55 ES2010d.A.spurt.18
A: Okay 19.2 19.93 ES2010a.A.spurt.5
B: Over here we're gonna have this which obviously between the power source and the rest of it you're gonna need to switch 829.44 834.83 ES2010b.B.spurt.296
C: Just give you ideas and and down at the bottom you have the logo is not we could put the r. r. 522.23 526.36 ES2010c.C.spurt.199
D: Yeah 45.33 45.51 ES2010d.D.spurt.19
A: hi everybody welcome to our kick-off meeting 19.93 22.47 ES2010a.A.spurt.6
B: Power source rather 1317.23 1318.38 ES2010b.A.spurt.504
C: And here's what we're each of us going to do the ideas going to be the look and feel design the u. i. d. the user interface design 1794.39 1801.85 ES2010c.A.spurt.787
D: Yeah 49.85 50.1 ES2010d.D.spurt.20
A: Um 25.92 26.68 ES2010a.A.spurt.8
B: the chip and of course the infrared bulb so we can communicate with the various devices that he needs to talk to 849.94 855.56 ES2010b.B.spurt.305
C: That squishy A squishy 1480.14 1481.78 ES2010c.D.spurt.647
D: Yeah 51.74 51.89 ES2010d.D.spurt.21
A: For now or 32.67 33.24 ES2010a.A.spurt.10
B: And Cents our findings found that people are willing to pay more money For a remote For it to be more High class 641.37 648.46 ES2010b.D.spurt.224
C: Uh with the round buttons and it's Sort of like you have the base of the kinda trendy it had but also very sleek and 380.62 387.98 ES2010c.C.spurt.151
D: Uh-huh 53.84 54.51 ES2010d.D.spurt.22
A: And in 33.67 34.34 ES2010a.A.spurt.11
B: Specifications like how how technically literate are these people we're going to be using a remote 1154.21 1158.55 ES2010b.A.spurt.437
C: So scroll buttons on the side and the buttons on top 1442.24 1444.69 ES2010c.D.spurt.627
D: That's it Well it's it's a it's a it's a 55.5 59.76 ES2010d.D.spurt.23
A: Yep 35.43 35.79 ES2010a.B.spurt.12
B: And also we found to our team the mets speech recognition 632.48 635.37 ES2010b.D.spurt.221
C: So you say about like What if we use our sales try and then at all gonna reach a colour or is it gonna be the kind of thing where people come back and swap it 1198.9 1207.15 ES2010c.C.spurt.492
D: Well cents 56.93 58.01 ES2010d.C.spurt.24
A: Alright 35.53 35.8 ES2010a.A.spurt.13
B: we can go and side the brightness the screen things like that all the more complicated functions and then use 287.07 292.92 ES2010b.C.spurt.100
C: And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons and and simpler design 504.94 510.21 ES2010c.C.spurt.194
D: I'm just gonna translate 61.67 62.96 ES2010d.C.spurt.25
A: Okay 36.54 37.12 ES2010a.A.spurt.14
B: Again which we need to replied that email and then we're gonna have lunch break and after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time 1709.8 1716.45 ES2010b.A.spurt.651
C: Yeah the problem is we're using latex over listen to it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons 1679.6 1685.76 ES2010c.B.spurt.740
D: So you choose to use 61.79 63.87 ES2010d.D.spurt.26
A: so first let's go to this powerpoint 37.12 40.01 ES2010a.A.spurt.15
B: You were side your presentation the engineering versus the user Specified remote i think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly 586.3 594.48 ES2010b.D.spurt.208
C: Honestly i think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did you do a nice small compact 1049.87 1056.8 ES2010c.B.spurt.405
D: Uh-huh but it's it's you can just be so 64.63 67.99 ES2010d.D.spurt.27
A: What what button press 42.16 43.43 ES2010a.A.spurt.16

C: If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would you know technology 907.88 913.31 ES2010c.A.spurt.344
D: The base 64.9 65.32 ES2010d.C.spurt.28
A: Just in and if you arrow 44.57 46.26 ES2010a.C.spurt.17
B: Most channel on off button volume 1213.1 1215.78 ES2010b.C.spurt.454
C: So a basic remote operation runs as well as That's button and makes a connection 584.71 590.21 ES2010c.B.spurt.230
D: Which is what we decided that's good 66.92 68.55 ES2010d.C.spurt.29
A: Yeah 47.07 47.49 ES2010a.A.spurt.18
B: Well i could be you know you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons 1633.24 1637.46 ES2010b.C.spurt.621
C: Because we could produce you know how cellphones have those overlay is that you can change the colour 1176.53 1182.15 ES2010c.B.spurt.480
D: Um 70.16 70.79 ES2010d.C.spurt.30
A: are and i just click 47.49 48.57 ES2010a.A.spurt.19
B: Well the function of a remote control as what um 230.04 233.89 ES2010b.C.spurt.85
C: On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that is more for like a d. v. d. function which are not gonna be you think 510.75 516.39 ES2010c.C.spurt.195
D: Mm 71.08 71.11 ES2010d.A.spurt.31
A: Okay here's our agenda for this meeting 49.11 51.23 ES2010a.A.spurt.20
B: Well how much extra would be additional chip be second a push us over production costs 749.52 754.67 ES2010b.C.spurt.269
C: Clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would all the make yellow So you're blue and yellow The touch buttons 1738.46 1744.52 ES2010c.D.spurt.765
D: Useful it's it's just 71.15 72.59 ES2010d.D.spurt.32
A: Um where start with our opening which was a introductions really get to know each other little bit better 51.75 56.76 ES2010a.A.spurt.21
B: Bland looking is just text on the screen not even yeah just black with Just text 1005.44 1011.04 ES2010b.A.spurt.369
C: So you could have two curves and match the shape of the hand to make it more palatable to whole 741.44 744.99 ES2010c.B.spurt.268
D: Just what you see as read um 72.34 74.23 ES2010d.C.spurt.33
A: Um 57.23 57.75 ES2010a.A.spurt.22
B: Because they only use ten percent buttons really 491.7 493.46 ES2010b.D.spurt.165
C: Which i think if we make it curved is like a a like a hand shape 1431.77 1435.21 ES2010c.B.spurt.621
D: Uh 73.92 75.04 ES2010d.D.spurt.34
A: Okay 70.98 71.63 ES2010a.A.spurt.25
B: a make a know if you don't wanna keep the number buttons down correct because people use ten percent 1222.9 1227.36 ES2010b.A.spurt.461
C: I i think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now i'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to 1142.69 1150.11 ES2010c.A.spurt.466
D: That can be replaceable 74.54 75.39 ES2010d.C.spurt.35
A: That's um 75.23 76.26 ES2010a.A.spurt.27
B: You push the button to find it it finds 1280.61 1283.16 ES2010b.B.spurt.488
C: And then we're going to come to a decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close that We have forty minutes yeah 53.14 60.22 ES2010c.A.spurt.36
D: it's it's 75.04 75.89 ES2010d.D.spurt.36
A: original trendy and also user-friendly 76.26 79.08 ES2010a.A.spurt.28
B: Just to clarify that speech recognition you mean they would say channel five and i think we can try 650.05 654.79 ES2010b.A.spurt.227
C: We need to decide well also we can figure out how big it's gonna be like exactly what buttons we wanna and exactly 991.0 997.49 ES2010c.D.spurt.380
D: Right 76.82 77.11 ES2010d.A.spurt.37
A: And how we're going to do it is each of us is going to um 84.5 88.69 ES2010a.A.spurt.29
B: As well as the age range So we need a him but not corny marketing scheme for Promoting our product 624.36 631.95 ES2010b.D.spurt.220
C: Yeah it's it's in classes were produce a chip taking would be more expensive 1118.28 1121.55 ES2010c.D.spurt.450
D: Um and then the button You kind of poking through rather than 77.32 80.12 ES2010d.C.spurt.38
A: Oh how is it can be used what's the actual goal here has to operate t. v. bulb uh-huh 93.18 98.86 ES2010a.A.spurt.31
B: I mean young an old are all age ranges all um 1128.25 1131.6 ES2010b.A.spurt.423
C: Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting 36.42 39.02 ES2010c.A.spurt.24
D: Oh well that's true 77.34 79.63 ES2010d.D.spurt.39
A: and we're going to do individual work on that and then me to 98.86 101.59 ES2010a.A.spurt.32
B: so we're going to go anywhere from tends to wood all in the age range 1141.68 1146.03 ES2010b.A.spurt.431
C: But it's sort of like just taking aspect of it and say well i have this one we like you know the round section of um or we'd like 543.04 550.67 ES2010c.C.spurt.206
D: Oh the buttons would be much longer 81.1 83.45 ES2010d.D.spurt.40
A: Right 122.13 122.65 ES2010a.A.spurt.38
B: Well it shouldn't be larger buttons in general you know like if the examples i had there's like quite small so should we trying go for So it has a larger buttons 910.12 918.84 ES2010b.C.spurt.340
C: fibreglass something copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself 639.44 642.9 ES2010c.B.spurt.239
D: No much slider but 82.45 83.49 ES2010d.C.spurt.41
A: First were gonna start off by using our Tools 123.35 126.45 ES2010a.A.spurt.39
B: We could just have the logo in yellow Or maybe a yellow light for the keys 1511.55 1515.99 ES2010b.A.spurt.582
C: I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in that direction of this kind of 1072.84 1075.95 ES2010c.A.spurt.418
D: Once it's it's slides 84.1 87.16 ES2010d.D.spurt.42

B: Selection button for various entertainment devices so you want something that will permit you to select 797.11 801.87 ES2010b.B.spurt.286
C: Yeah because i mean if even looking at cell phones right now 1080.01 1082.96 ES2010c.D.spurt.425
D: A see-through Just a very pale blue on a light up yellow and whole 84.27 88.4 ES2010d.C.spurt.43
A: I think we should for go to be whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing 134.97 138.47 ES2010a.B.spurt.41
B: And then we're going to determine the technical functions 137.94 140.9 ES2010b.A.spurt.54
C: That's like you know what i can add cell phone it's like the the screen 1695.12 1698.49 ES2010c.C.spurt.748
D: Hold it like that and just uh 88.09 91.91 ES2010d.D.spurt.44
A: We could 137.05 137.4 ES2010a.D.spurt.42
B: Examples and see if there's anything which was used technical functions 1567.89 1571.36 ES2010b.A.spurt.603
C: Well it's sort of like have a the uh yellow strip at the bottom 1518.3 1521.76 ES2010c.C.spurt.666
D: huh 91.91 92.05 ES2010d.D.spurt.45
A: We did it on here 138.92 139.68 ES2010a.D.spurt.43
B: Like what functions so we want it to include and how simple complex it should be 352.94 357.49 ES2010b.C.spurt.115
C: Alright but it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say channel up and it would work right 1295.77 1300.54 ES2010c.A.spurt.547
D: Um and then the bottom we have our logo 93.29 95.43 ES2010d.C.spurt.46
A: Alright let's go for it then 139.8 140.98 ES2010a.A.spurt.44
B: And so personally i think that we need a moderate eye-catching design but it it it really need to be simple so 577.8 584.21 ES2010b.D.spurt.206
