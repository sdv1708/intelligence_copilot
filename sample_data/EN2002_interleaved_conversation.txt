A: Put an extra button extra few buttons next to summarise button so that you	117.3	120.96	EN2002a.C.spurt.62 And so we can't put it on i think we could put it on the right click We could for example have a little menu that pops up	162.67	168.78	EN2002a.C.spurt.79 piece of that topic either what are we decide the default a beamer that's in all meetings or just in one meeting in the shop a bit together Instances of that topic	443.4	451.71	EN2002a.A.spurt.227 Actually yeah but i'm not a common thing what if we have it so so that that's um if you doubleclicking goes to defaulting on the menu i mean that's Kind of a typical kinda	426.08	434.63	EN2002a.A.spurt.221
B: You have a higher level rather than kinda you're playing around a little bit code modifying your code in this and uh	1486.84	1491.97	EN2002b.D.spurt.824 Try to tell whether was a a transcript or whatever and then up or highlighting something in the transcript window	999.49	1003.94	EN2002b.D.spurt.560 trying to to do a different kind of to go to different window so if you wanna go to the actual highlight the transcript and i like the top or something	1042.5	1050.29	EN2002b.D.spurt.583 Yeah one meeting it's time and it's there is no text file or x. m. l. or whatever it is but	1561.71	1566.02	EN2002b.D.spurt.856
C: To you They separate that's a bit what they put that the dialogue acts like a double a common ago last uh just ignore they need any coding zero "'cause" it's got nothing to do with	746.14	754.41	EN2002d.C.spurt.433 I think we should have the global top five That "'cause" it it speakers got top a top whatever and so just say one of the box is just explains that this is my top five dollar that is	612.65	621.14	EN2002d.C.spurt.361 and speaking characterisation we know we had a heading in the top five dialogue acts	601.06	605.41	EN2002d.B.spurt.358 And then a little brackets but then no actually the top five but top five minus the most common ones which are you know	605.96	612.04	EN2002d.B.spurt.359
A: open thing you or the whole put it like a ball what e. d. t. v. to make it how do you figure out that it's uses	1347.84	1355.13	EN2002a.B.spurt.801 Sounds reasonable to have like transcripts Like maybe three alternates button like four meeting meeting without disfluencies and some rice	796.02	803.91	EN2002a.B.spurt.444 And well it's in the code just that it you know i mean you define i said object and then you'd search but strange have to figure out how to has to do same thing for the summary that sorry	1358.83	1370.43	EN2002a.C.spurt.805 To find the transcripts for certain meeting it does does uh icsi search	1295.7	1300.24	EN2002a.C.spurt.773
B: No i wouldn't wanna have to put it take put it back into it's about over the entire e. d. n. x. so i would always a couple good enough	1439.23	1445.2	EN2002b.B.spurt.798 And that comes with the whole load of Highlighting Extras as well as i said you know if you if you have taken something for example highlights automatically	1124.78	1133.06	EN2002b.C.spurt.619 Straight from you know you get you get the result and then there's a sort of statement saying is straight on the you know brought palm a level saying if it if you found a segment then	1017.08	1025.71	EN2002b.C.spurt.568 I think yeah probably buying meeting makes more sense i mean essentially their time you know in time order so	947.35	953.19	EN2002b.D.spurt.544
C: And then the top five in that me in the global top of this meeting in in the rest is	644.16	647.51	EN2002d.C.spurt.370 The mob simple chip uh but that's pretty much going on so i'll be that's not just put it up as you can still using that	780.65	785.91	EN2002d.C.spurt.460 What percentage of dialogue acts that he makes a lot so i guess In the meeting and i believe separately sorry one's one	720.44	727.61	EN2002d.C.spurt.423 The dialogue acts are all done a natural i'm using some of them but the some of them so but i think as you wanna talk about all this was um	475.4	483.01	EN2002d.C.spurt.299
A: Action would happen The double click on a particular topic or something then it goes to sort of like a default	435.1	439.8	EN2002a.A.spurt.222 Have the default double click so physically so be it was from a new pope	476.86	480.39	EN2002a.A.spurt.241 Uh open up stick to observational to such an open to that	81.59	84.75	EN2002a.C.spurt.50 Well the thing is typically those someone gonna have five windows open same time calling know	626.34	630.33	EN2002a.A.spurt.333
B: I think it's like well how would we displayed a like a big you take this functions and just could you could a text file think they just want to a text on them	1297.03	1303.5	EN2002b.D.spurt.734 A waste of highlighting in in the transcript when they're doesn't it	1073.04	1075.85	EN2002b.C.spurt.596 Are you select what we want just like that so there's not a any text and segments	1233.09	1237.25	EN2002b.B.spurt.683 Well transcript be so on and trendy know "'cause" then we need all the other day that we wanna keep the transcript	1208.55	1213.14	EN2002b.D.spurt.671
C: Feasible to open up more than one Well it's maybe in normal objects as we can for each meeting today but we we're gonna use like figure that the right and it makes sense like to be looking through the highest rank one's first So we are gonna look through only five um just pick the top five to	1038.9	1053.8	EN2002d.D.spurt.640 If there's like three the top meetings like like i said before language looking forward language and get the highest rated ones should look for the terms we're not putting it out of all seventy six	1934.66	1943.94	EN2002d.D.spurt.1209 Or a dove we have like a a choice so they can filter those out that the top most common just a a cable show wall or shall	578.71	585.75	EN2002d.D.spurt.349 We could have like that need that say is "'cause" it "'cause" it's a speaker when that is we characterisation when it comes out so you got the global one that know he could just have the top five in this meeting	635.38	643.26	EN2002d.C.spurt.367
A: No this is not the actual search this is just when you open what you know so i read the transcript for example	1289.14	1295.1	EN2002a.C.spurt.769 And then when you get on the menu you can select uh summarisation box which pops up And and all japan	59.35	66.66	EN2002a.C.spurt.45 Yeah or even just uh buttons on top of buttons or something	707.75	710.57	EN2002a.A.spurt.389 I she in the transcription part also that you click on the button and then the evidence whether that speaker a protectionist	121.62	127.32	EN2002a.C.spurt.63
B: You can yeah you do it together with With the t. transcription with the racial transcription have more um power all	1344.14	1350.19	EN2002b.C.spurt.761 In in other languages just that It's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally wanted to put into like a list box or something	992.52	999.08	EN2002b.D.spurt.559 There is some there's a method that put things back into x. m. l. format	1218.27	1221.69	EN2002b.B.spurt.678 So maybe i mean we we should we should definitely well we could probably not put it under this heading but i put it on that changes since the initial specification	374.61	382.08	EN2002b.C.spurt.209
C: Well the evaluation Pretty much straight away and then get	1468.99	1472.04	EN2002d.C.spurt.957 and that works when you when you left double click on a topic l. meetings or it then it like that	1847.67	1853.67	EN2002d.B.spurt.1176 I mean is tiny so we can already put more than one count the video one sort of simple	898.59	902.99	EN2002d.B.spurt.545 And yeah the top left at them and have contacts which is you know n. x. t. and it's sort of a bit cheeky to use that	846.75	853.12	EN2002d.B.spurt.496
A: Like be able to click on that topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that	393.07	397.63	EN2002a.C.spurt.202 either we could do that you know when is the pop up our my that we can when you click on that the i. d. any sort of i. d. in the transcription box	106.95	115.05	EN2002a.C.spurt.60 And the summary for examples to be call you up in the winter you read through it you might click got you know close again straight away	639.67	645.92	EN2002a.C.spurt.340 Yeah but then and then there's a problem with a lot of windows popping up again in a pop up with that you even being quite sure what is you know i mean	486.31	493.85	EN2002a.C.spurt.248
B: i guess actually um paul i think is i think them at school "'cause" that should be And this is cool start time and time	726.24	731.57	EN2002b.B.spurt.424 And then to learn to find accommodations and with the the done that that would mean that you can only these things on fashion i like him to become one level	1257.89	1264.85	EN2002b.B.spurt.711 I dunno moving in a higher level i guess	1503.57	1505.43	EN2002b.D.spurt.832 No no no it shouldn't be know that should be higher level it should be	1520.75	1524.41	EN2002b.D.spurt.837
C: We could put it in a certain kind of package	818.63	820.67	EN2002d.C.spurt.480 But you can double click on it	843.09	844.53	EN2002d.C.spurt.492 If you are in a double click on one	1739.87	1741.67	EN2002d.B.spurt.1125 the same on this one at least that you if you double of click very close	1861.21	1865.29	EN2002d.B.spurt.1180
A: To get that they say for example to get a summarisation data you have to search for i think the i. d.s or something	1247.35	1254.22	EN2002a.C.spurt.750 So we have basically two options of of browsing the meetings is by by that	411.26	415.98	EN2002a.C.spurt.218 Yeah like lot of these can be like once we get the disfluencies out the meeting be a transcript but on the disfluency transcript with the phone just want to have all these yep have all these sort of using the same and on so we can do a lot of	762.18	773.97	EN2002a.A.spurt.427 The transcription boxes got some i've got a button which doesn't do anything yet	90.09	95.24	EN2002a.C.spurt.53
B: That kinda makes more sense	954.81	956.04	EN2002b.D.spurt.546 L. c. and then it's kinda like there's usually things built in to well should be built and it yeah well i mean To process	1417.41	1423.24	EN2002b.D.spurt.790 I just think i might try and talked to was a jonathan thing which is to see what they what system they used it all this stuff could be nice to have all the tools there and just like have topic model and just kinda like plug and play with everything in just actually use a system	1471.68	1486.11	EN2002b.D.spurt.822 it should work with anything do we do like highlighting yeah	1083.89	1087.32	EN2002b.D.spurt.601
C: For the speaker and then in the meeting you have what you could either have the most commonly occurring ones we could have a list of each speaker is top uh that is	621.91	629.32	EN2002d.C.spurt.363 Well sort of the times today	1264.36	1265.97	EN2002d.B.spurt.800 It it it's not Starts at three it's not too pretty but that that was it doesn't matter	365.4	369.66	EN2002d.C.spurt.230 Adam and then as well the whole we know is a pop up on a pretty tall but	370.79	374.68	EN2002d.B.spurt.234
A: But yeah it depends i mean i i really wanna put the summary in some way uh you know	635.46	639.03	EN2002a.C.spurt.338 Individual observations um and then we have the entire linking by right click basically	419.34	424.18	EN2002a.C.spurt.220 That could means all way to find the kind of a you wanna you know whatever you wanna do than just sending you know	1400.07	1405.54	EN2002a.C.spurt.824 In munich like it and just think they have the d. folder so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do when we know that that's most common thing that's gonna happen so the double click want to have insisted on the trouble break like in choosing among the menu	452.26	462.71	EN2002a.A.spurt.228
B: isn't jonathan think something like that because just like one is we implement one of these interfaces for at this particular type when do we should be able to have that highlighting	1091.75	1099.09	EN2002b.D.spurt.606 Text area also Something uh	1146.91	1149.42	EN2002b.B.spurt.634 Norman text areas uh	1150.49	1152.1	EN2002b.C.spurt.637 Is it broke of text	1205.77	1206.93	EN2002b.B.spurt.668
C: Yeah "'cause" i forget my as well i was just like every time put something in there	144.67	148.02	EN2002d.D.spurt.75 Yeah i would make them bit nicer to have more time that may look like	376.11	379.63	EN2002d.B.spurt.236 A bit more time	1489.59	1490.5	EN2002d.D.spurt.970 "'cause" i was trying some stuff A couple weeks ago	216.93	220.04	EN2002d.D.spurt.125
A: One option will be in the only meetings characterise a speaker	275.88	279.12	EN2002a.C.spurt.149 I mean it's not as extensible but we wanna add more things in the future um you know need buttons i don't know where is the menu that thing is	230.51	236.34	EN2002a.A.spurt.123 you know the top down menus and take buttons on it from gonna do i	1747.24	1750.7	EN2002a.C.spurt.1034 I don't know about that i mean is the speaker characterisations bit like you said i mean it's like a nice thing	321.33	326.84	EN2002a.C.spurt.173
B: "'cause" we extract out of the file when we create a text file	1309.64	1312.59	EN2002b.D.spurt.739 Like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as well as in the summaries	816.62	820.73	EN2002b.D.spurt.473 Yeah exactly yeah so the summary in the topic and then transcript yeah	921.75	925.25	EN2002b.D.spurt.527 Yeah and what fills the transcription box and all of these boxes is a special form of paying	1107.96	1113.27	EN2002b.C.spurt.612
C: The thing is that yeah there is as i said a while ago there's still this one error which is uh bugging in n. x. t.	313.15	319.74	EN2002d.B.spurt.207 That common	668.91	669.8	EN2002d.C.spurt.383 yeah i mean just keep it simple as	765.33	767.5	EN2002d.B.spurt.447 And it's like course a while ago um it's just that that is yeah that's	1341.09	1344.66	EN2002d.D.spurt.860
A: I think by default there	917.02	918.16	EN2002a.A.spurt.514 Click on speech characterisation i hope so in there	174.06	176.65	EN2002a.C.spurt.82 but we have the the right click mean you can have a menu right click but instead of like	471.84	476.19	EN2002a.A.spurt.239 Pretty ugly what kind of things you wanna be able to search for	1713.74	1716.86	EN2002a.C.spurt.1013
B: Only kind of drinks	45.79	46.95	EN2002b.A.spurt.21 More kind	681.74	682.27	EN2002b.A.spurt.407 It may be difficult to get that information back	1004.5	1006.99	EN2002b.D.spurt.561 That's expensive There's a few little things that happen in just doesn't but you save Certain things in this is kind of	1035.45	1041.54	EN2002b.D.spurt.578
C: it should be for a simple to just get the topics and the summaries for using that text extracted	1986.17	1992.03	EN2002d.A.spurt.1231 Although yeah this this will uh this is actually different from how we painted appear like for doing global search then we are gonna do it like how we said before and pop up a list of The various meetings	1915.5	1924.22	EN2002d.D.spurt.1202 But if that's the top of the cinema why half an hour textured	432.75	436.18	EN2002d.C.spurt.271 How old t. v. that in top or as well old t. v. we you can just search for each specific out of that	560.03	565.72	EN2002d.C.spurt.341
A: The menu pop up that	220.47	221.61	EN2002a.C.spurt.113 the new type of remote dialogue acts or something is wrong speaker characterisation and in time	303.77	308.16	EN2002a.A.spurt.168 Uh be a bit annoying if you have a life like for one thing and double a. or something yeah	147.56	151.66	EN2002a.C.spurt.75 Wonder how much of the meetings is talking about stuff meetings	0.91	3.61	EN2002a.A.spurt.2
B: Right it back to h. t. m. l. i mean extra well if we take if we did the price is saying	1192.29	1196.73	EN2002b.B.spurt.664 Oh kind yeah	1715.34	1716.19	EN2002b.C.spurt.934 A great back any in like a things that i thought was wrong in english or whatever i like there are probably	1736.59	1743.34	EN2002b.A.spurt.955 Irritating dialogue back	1743.01	1744.29	EN2002b.D.spurt.959
C: Yeah just do it Top five but local and viable and then have another	649.97	654.03	EN2002d.B.spurt.376 One guy has top five taiwan and start as an undergrad i	670.22	674.65	EN2002d.C.spurt.384 but then expect discourse be some of the top but	1080.85	1083.82	EN2002d.A.spurt.668 Meeting nice about all the different dialects for each person in the meeting	553.47	557.36	EN2002d.C.spurt.339
A: Less time you call your problem is something so we talking and somebody else or something	585.05	589.59	EN2002a.D.spurt.317 Yeah "'cause" i got scrap saying about four five bits and that they would do quite a bit for a job "'cause" it can also there's no way of nominate people in the right to	1940.33	1947.87	EN2002a.D.spurt.1172 "'kay" use double click or	142.57	143.99	EN2002a.B.spurt.72 But if you did double click on something don't you	496.24	499.19	EN2002a.B.spurt.251
B: If we need the outline of the prototype i mean what what we're gonna put and uh	146.3	150.2	EN2002b.C.spurt.54 Well just sort of well the thing is yeah we're gonna be talking all of trained on the part for the progress and putting a screen shot some of us yeah	150.07	157.03	EN2002b.D.spurt.55 Um put your person to into this one	227.57	229.49	EN2002b.D.spurt.88 Like should put it a hint that something like that might happen in to the document	475.74	479.0	EN2002b.D.spurt.290
C: Do you wanna keep that like are we keeping that how that happens it just print everything out in the in the shell as well which is it does everything it just kind I guess that's it's default be a very way says it can it was really do anything so	301.88	312.62	EN2002d.D.spurt.203 Today here	400.95	401.68	EN2002d.C.spurt.252 Nasty so i'm quite loud and it looks in and not nice someone and all those kind of thing	401.42	406.12	EN2002d.B.spurt.254 Well it's kind of boring yeah	515.59	517.33	EN2002d.D.spurt.316
A: Um or just you know just a button	204.64	206.52	EN2002a.C.spurt.106 Edible buttons	234.61	235.46	EN2002a.D.spurt.125 What if right right click that'll happen then it's like more if it's a bit sure yeah	215.54	220.5	EN2002a.B.spurt.109 Which sign that for now and put it in the yeah	591.32	594.06	EN2002a.D.spurt.318
B: Or we could just put them all into one result pain	928.6	930.62	EN2002b.D.spurt.532 You put it into yeah	1410.86	1411.8	EN2002b.D.spurt.785 Um that's what the only sure how put on the fly	1574.03	1576.1	EN2002b.D.spurt.862 Cover the topic segmentation one	209.87	211.37	EN2002b.B.spurt.78
C: Today was right	1144.38	1145.14	EN2002d.C.spurt.719 And uh i wanna get him today which will be	1678.5	1681.63	EN2002d.B.spurt.1097 Big part i mean how to get that that communication between the two different kinds windows	1746.89	1750.81	EN2002d.D.spurt.1129 Well we we can make sense it would be kind of	2064.86	2067.02	EN2002d.D.spurt.1278
A: Put into when it is	1115.08	1116.42	EN2002a.C.spurt.663 I don't know no one's both of them as a vice versa do the summarisation thing about	1483.07	1487.51	EN2002a.C.spurt.887 Um just like the basic so i think	1810.26	1811.92	EN2002a.A.spurt.1059 Just like a landing the corn just sort of i'll just see the basics of what you've done i just get uh a quick look over and just	1817.45	1822.84	EN2002a.A.spurt.1064
B: Search yeah	428.8	429.45	EN2002b.D.spurt.254 So it a six day city the topic segmentation it's not use this is i	441.1	444.92	EN2002b.B.spurt.263 The topic segmentation the the l. c. second textiles and basically down just needs to be	508.61	514.35	EN2002b.B.spurt.316 Down these are in the car yeah it shouldn't be a search of the parameters place main or something	514.98	520.1	EN2002b.B.spurt.318
C: Like did When exactly where we're gonna start evaluation	1166.15	1169.33	EN2002d.D.spurt.734 The thing is yeah we had the the deadline last friday but it's We wanna be able to doing evaluation doing the weekend anyway	1193.07	1200.74	EN2002d.B.spurt.747 Do we have to have done the evaluation by then	1397.66	1400.34	EN2002d.B.spurt.904 I thought the evaluation maybe for the report So then that's done the twenty first point fifty is Isn't it is it That's what i understood	1403.34	1410.78	EN2002d.D.spurt.907
A: The basics	1823.37	1823.92	EN2002a.A.spurt.1066 Well i think it basically said	2065.73	2067.32	EN2002a.B.spurt.1263 Joost was saying we know for transcription and summary	659.79	663.43	EN2002a.B.spurt.348 Contents of the thing we know like from the transcription to summary	700.19	703.3	EN2002a.B.spurt.384
B: Like a plane when you claim the other for the search things and then we could leave that one is uh a joint one	607.24	611.47	EN2002b.D.spurt.366 when he pulls up the segments	704.01	705.61	EN2002b.B.spurt.415 Should finish it actually just to clarify last we gonna talk about are search results um	811.6	816.21	EN2002b.D.spurt.472 I thought we we sort of discussed last week as targets are on the same window um so will be on the street when the bottom have to search window	852.41	860.02	EN2002b.D.spurt.489
C: Evaluation know you do you guys	1434.98	1436.84	EN2002d.D.spurt.942 well you know that the question is it do we need the evaluation for the presentation	1437.32	1441.11	EN2002d.B.spurt.944 Just to ask whether we need to have evaluation done for the demonstration or	1559.81	1563.43	EN2002d.D.spurt.1030 How is housing going with you evaluation	1590.34	1593.34	EN2002d.B.spurt.1044
A: No no it could be like transcription summary like two colours and you just	719.01	723.74	EN2002a.B.spurt.397 I had to had to understand how to do the transcript how they did the transcript to do some so	1371.97	1376.51	EN2002a.C.spurt.808 I dunno if you looked at the search query language but it's like a dollar eighty	1314.66	1319.48	EN2002a.C.spurt.783 Meet up and see what we could you know mean i dunno you what you've done and see you what do we need	1158.26	1164.32	EN2002a.B.spurt.689
B: No i don't know so is this is one week like to know topics and summaries for what we wanna search channel that you have to be to result beans So for one for topics one for i dunno the cats um	892.85	904.95	EN2002b.D.spurt.512 certain segments of things that we want to select of each at the moment you press that one of them or just one if we're gonna That he's out some of the prince evans	1240.34	1248.22	EN2002b.C.spurt.689 The room like on that experiment disfluencies "'cause" we're gonna search it and we're not gonna	1277.13	1282.84	EN2002b.A.spurt.719 Yeah well i mean is up to you if you wanna keep them and uh i'm happy to do some as well um last time tonight	253.78	259.17	EN2002b.C.spurt.115
C: and then i mean vita but they have only evaluation stuff that's gonna be quite of tastes but	1652.28	1658.14	EN2002d.A.spurt.1082 See with steve says about the evaluation and then like	2164.8	2168.85	EN2002d.A.spurt.1318 If you change your window manager like like a little bit nicer	383.07	385.33	EN2002d.D.spurt.241 I think in that you be a bit difficult	594.76	596.82	EN2002d.B.spurt.356
A: Yeah well in it i guess in in the meeting browser one point one you can have a menu instead of rubber i	238.89	245.67	EN2002a.D.spurt.129 A menu is one of the thing is that would might be a bit wait for it just probably not stuff for that	192.31	197.9	EN2002a.D.spurt.96 And and that's i think such works as well so you can pop up research and it lights up um	68.76	74.69	EN2002a.C.spurt.47 We wanna pop up when the with the speaker hard drive actually	101.43	103.91	EN2002a.C.spurt.57
B: Was anything else we want it at the time line i mean essentially was what like	316.75	320.51	EN2002b.D.spurt.165 It's a good thing to have to say we care what we could have done that we had more time give you to work things and it's to get the conclusion	357.33	363.14	EN2002b.B.spurt.192 The final report sure that we have more time is it	363.66	366.44	EN2002b.B.spurt.195 The three was to discover some sort of time warp thing it's not happen	367.92	371.71	EN2002b.D.spurt.202
C: i was thinking that um is sort of turned out that way a bit than that	803.43	806.37	EN2002d.B.spurt.470 yeah i i know yeah i know how to how to put it back but	940.95	944.1	EN2002d.B.spurt.575 No but i think if you put it ties in a display just only	984.51	987.03	EN2002d.C.spurt.606 So we will be a bit different from	1958.18	1959.73	EN2002d.D.spurt.1220
A: And i i see what we could do is on in that many as well which should have an option that pops up all we know with all the	250.11	257.58	EN2002a.C.spurt.138 I was uh and it Figures out what's the most common	478.17	481.17	EN2002a.D.spurt.242 Shows that could be you know already so we're going to do have to do all the work again i'm just like figured out stuff	1803.62	1809.89	EN2002a.B.spurt.1058 The the full transcription and the summer at same time	653.35	656.23	EN2002a.B.spurt.346
B: Times two	387.11	387.93	EN2002b.C.spurt.217 No for time to look at that point or	601.68	603.4	EN2002b.D.spurt.360 How we could do that like from the the the extract worse that you did like also in it is extract to time stamps and	691.49	700.25	EN2002b.A.spurt.411 And then he they automatically or you can just caught on inside know get me the time stamps so you say	719.25	725.07	EN2002b.B.spurt.422
C: Channel like how it all integrated global bonds and so	1612.75	1615.19	EN2002d.D.spurt.1054 When when we did a global search at least	1962.13	1963.74	EN2002d.D.spurt.1222 A global search	2014.03	2014.98	EN2002d.B.spurt.1244 A gonna be able to do a global search the topics	2049.58	2051.73	EN2002d.C.spurt.1267
A: Can i dunno but transcripts	792.73	794.67	EN2002a.B.spurt.441 I dunno it transcript	1302.93	1304.24	EN2002a.C.spurt.776 We mean the the speaker characterisation oh well yeah i mean	316.56	319.76	EN2002a.C.spurt.171 If you i dunno click on the topic you get	348.37	351.1	EN2002a.B.spurt.182
B: there is at that time	772.48	774.05	EN2002b.D.spurt.443 Shouldn't time	809.64	810.32	EN2002b.D.spurt.471 Oh i like the idea of time in that case	904.71	906.83	EN2002b.C.spurt.517 But then you can see uh all of them at the same time i was just like	906.12	909.15	EN2002b.D.spurt.518
C: We want to be doing a global search on the topics for are topics since the dawn of labels	2084.54	2090.22	EN2002d.D.spurt.1288 Uh solar yeah so that it that it says that he was because they are in which meeting and then you can see which topics which	458.38	464.66	EN2002d.C.spurt.290 Now if this was called meeting in speaker	809.42	811.43	EN2002d.C.spurt.473 Super size meeting browser	880.86	882.25	EN2002d.D.spurt.530
A: So the right click on a menu you know i mean you can	170.62	173.31	EN2002a.C.spurt.81 I don't know about you but a eugene windows right click Doesn't do anything is that it happens a menu	186.96	192.4	EN2002a.C.spurt.94 And it's called d. n. browser	959.51	961.78	EN2002a.C.spurt.549 I yeah well find it	1015.43	1016.52	EN2002a.D.spurt.592
B: It's the button this time is	1341.79	1343.04	EN2002b.B.spurt.760 Style sheet time to know	1415.31	1416.83	EN2002b.D.spurt.788 Time use my pen	1751.02	1752.05	EN2002b.C.spurt.969 Very interesting started the meeting	82.43	84.17	EN2002b.A.spurt.30
C: Mm welcome to the meeting	971.99	974.01	EN2002d.C.spurt.596 I i'm sure we could do that and i can meeting	1184.84	1186.82	EN2002d.B.spurt.742 Oh but we just have a regular tuesday meeting with "'em"	1236.72	1238.64	EN2002d.D.spurt.777 That's why i think that's why we didn't have the the meeting	1245.08	1247.56	EN2002d.D.spurt.785
A: Foreign aid what like it just doesn't happen very well trends but this whatever find everything that's got that and then like	1306.96	1313.65	EN2002a.D.spurt.779 Well it's easy to find it what's a small l. a. l. s. i.	1469.89	1473.03	EN2002a.D.spurt.876 Nine nine called a little ten or something yeah	1534.88	1537.62	EN2002a.C.spurt.917 I um i dunno it doesn't matter If if you want to i mean it's just You know there um some extra have some time	1504.94	1511.2	EN2002a.A.spurt.902
B: Okay i'm gonna try to minimise the amount of change the meeting browser yes	805.5	809.17	EN2002b.D.spurt.470 especially if you get If you get results for the same meeting	918.31	921.7	EN2002b.C.spurt.523 I mean we could we could order them but meeting at some point	932.14	934.92	EN2002b.C.spurt.535 I mean these meetings a lot and as you know it's just words and to print one of them out selectively	1325.58	1331.1	EN2002b.C.spurt.753
C: Well that's in a meeting	1510.62	1511.64	EN2002d.B.spurt.996 just made some comments the last meeting just	1610.02	1612.07	EN2002d.D.spurt.1053 We need we need to um right click on the topic it pops open the list of meetings are contain up pop	1839.2	1844.59	EN2002d.B.spurt.1173 Because you need uh any any ever have one meeting and and and those results will be uh	1894.83	1899.26	EN2002d.B.spurt.1194
A: We have to have speaker kinda nice to have this before we close they are wheel of this area it	364.42	368.9	EN2002a.D.spurt.188 What kinda prototype could we could use	820.23	822.48	EN2002a.C.spurt.454 I think it's kinda went and saw that really thing it thing it's all to store today stuff for them to be	870.93	876.17	EN2002a.D.spurt.484 That's kinda tidy	1903.74	1904.69	EN2002a.C.spurt.1138
B: A bit	93.24	93.53	EN2002b.C.spurt.34 Or some of them were a bit later somewhere yeah	412.9	414.99	EN2002b.D.spurt.234 Yeah that make it disappear but we want to do it down a bit	495.34	497.66	EN2002b.B.spurt.306 Be taken any more look at it a bit slides okay	593.87	596.7	EN2002b.D.spurt.355
C: For the one meeting	1895.09	1896.03	EN2002d.A.spurt.1195 Because you know if you get back several different meetings yeah	1909.3	1912.01	EN2002d.B.spurt.1199 In even you know one meeting and then you can confide anything	1912.38	1915.07	EN2002d.B.spurt.1201 On on a result that is contained in the meeting there's curve here and Racial crossfire like	1966.9	1972.52	EN2002d.B.spurt.1226
A: And it kind of just it just develops are not	829.65	832.73	EN2002a.C.spurt.457 Actually is the code accessible like the the gooey stuff the you've done and what can we just like a collect way the stuff out of	891.95	898.68	EN2002a.A.spurt.498 Kind of see if there's anything out there to use it sort of	1005.96	1010.14	EN2002a.B.spurt.582 To go but we just use the code like that is but i'm the question she asked them and you just	1023.53	1027.51	EN2002a.A.spurt.599
B: Broken these things tomorrow bit more as well so i don't know	644.14	647.61	EN2002b.A.spurt.386 I mean with the intention that this is done i mean and also Some sometimes it a bit of a motivating factor to you i mean you write down the words and ideas of how would you want to do something yeah	655.55	666.38	EN2002b.D.spurt.391 At that point that's what we're stuck in a little bit tricky "'cause" you're Working with an event handle are within the one I know where it was box whatever it is	1050.78	1057.78	EN2002b.D.spurt.585 The frame bit too	1538.76	1539.57	EN2002b.A.spurt.847
C: Yeah with that we need another meeting this week	2181.06	2183.37	EN2002d.C.spurt.1323 I think it every time i	21.61	23.32	EN2002d.A.spurt.10 I know it's it's like you can use the stuff later on in your life you need to spend the time to invest overall about the base like	180.29	185.42	EN2002d.D.spurt.95 i i time	249.26	250.36	EN2002d.D.spurt.158
A: Yeah did we using coding stuff and just like okay	1028.15	1030.7	EN2002a.A.spurt.602 well i i i don't know if it's usable i i can i haven't looked at it that but i found some code for like from my editorial about uh indexing or whatever yeah	1033.2	1041.51	EN2002a.B.spurt.609 To buy say we got kind is what i mean that's not to um	1452.03	1455.56	EN2002a.D.spurt.858 With the code honour yeah	1952.35	1954.0	EN2002a.D.spurt.1176
B: Might lose a bit of cutting its e. v. d. uh as was thinking that sometimes is easy to have the topic in its own instructions user interface about three charges easy we can uh	1625.59	1633.73	EN2002b.B.spurt.889 It's a bit	1701.23	1701.79	EN2002b.B.spurt.921 Yeah	9.78	9.97	EN2002b.A.spurt.1 Oh	14.0	14.1	EN2002b.C.spurt.2
C: As anyone have time to to play with it	282.42	284.55	EN2002d.B.spurt.190 Yeah i was more or less just playing with the things that to do to record whatever since i didn't didn't take it for full to strike at that time	347.77	354.41	EN2002d.D.spurt.223 There are some like uh all the time that i just i don't know how interesting there are so if i want statement is that it will buy remove because we've just got everything is prefix but statement every single button it stops a statement and um	483.92	498.04	EN2002d.C.spurt.300 Several have an acknowledgement as a big one that comes up all the time yes i questions um	528.74	533.62	EN2002d.C.spurt.328
A: Whether you wanna double speaker current position and	2101.27	2103.41	EN2002a.A.spurt.1279 Like a search for the user	261.35	263.24	EN2002a.C.spurt.143 And searching and i mean	416.91	418.53	EN2002a.C.spurt.219 searching yeah i i Where did is used	1013.83	1016.47	EN2002a.B.spurt.588
B: Okay	16.61	16.93	EN2002b.B.spurt.3 Mm	22.44	22.62	EN2002b.C.spurt.4 Three	24.11	25.34	EN2002b.A.spurt.5 Wants to take notes	26.15	27.61	EN2002b.A.spurt.6

A: Well the searching stuff like that then invert it files stuff and uh	1013.84	1017.48	EN2002a.A.spurt.589 Found that it will but i in very searching indexing but i haven't read it yeah	1019.43	1024.25	EN2002a.B.spurt.598 just search for specific	1380.0	1381.97	EN2002a.C.spurt.812 Search	1600.37	1600.82	EN2002a.A.spurt.958

C: that's a that's a one it's an i. whether or not we just them i mean you can get There's a method they would just give it a five for all the topics you give it a number they'll do that or whatever	541.26	549.74	EN2002d.C.spurt.333 Uh-huh	548.7	548.97	EN2002d.B.spurt.334 Yeah	549.11	549.59	EN2002d.D.spurt.335 cool	549.59	549.81	EN2002d.D.spurt.336
A: Um	606.79	607.33	EN2002a.C.spurt.325 Yeah well what do people think in general but the windows clustering that you mentioned Do you think	610.03	614.59	EN2002a.C.spurt.326 The thing is you know on	615.36	616.2	EN2002a.C.spurt.327 I think we probably need that don't have that for flexibility we need to have under but um	615.49	620.36	EN2002a.A.spurt.328
B: But there's a part yeah	575.16	576.41	EN2002b.D.spurt.344 Yeah	576.01	576.49	EN2002b.A.spurt.345 i think so yeah well yeah i'm very far	576.41	578.21	EN2002b.D.spurt.346 i mean we have now waiting for that then you have the other but what about them	576.49	580.7	EN2002b.A.spurt.347

A: That's what i feel as though i mean i'm i'm very much Are are wanna have everything	619.06	623.44	EN2002a.C.spurt.329 yeah	620.36	620.66	EN2002a.A.spurt.330 Customisable	624.01	624.98	EN2002a.C.spurt.331 Um	625.64	626.13	EN2002a.C.spurt.332
B: Exactly	579.75	580.2	EN2002b.D.spurt.348 "'cause" um disfluencies Should we	582.17	584.48	EN2002b.A.spurt.349 No but for skipping the audio one and then set easier	583.51	587.16	EN2002b.D.spurt.350 Um	587.64	588.05	EN2002b.D.spurt.351
C: Do you think i'd rather than	569.12	570.45	EN2002d.C.spurt.343 We're words for the line about change that	571.25	573.3	EN2002d.C.spurt.344 Uh-huh	574.09	574.46	EN2002d.B.spurt.345 Um so that i what we want to display that's what i thought last year it it it	574.46	578.77	EN2002d.C.spurt.346
A: Oh we just two or three three of whatever whatever they're looking of like teletext or whatever	630.83	635.23	EN2002a.A.spurt.334 Pretty not no yeah	630.94	632.25	EN2002a.C.spurt.335 Two or three maybe but	632.68	633.85	EN2002a.C.spurt.336 Yeah	634.48	634.96	EN2002a.C.spurt.337
B: You just keep it together on the i think the paper	588.34	591.62	EN2002b.A.spurt.352 Have you taken any more for a look at it	591.59	593.01	EN2002b.D.spurt.353 There right now and just see what what	592.04	593.74	EN2002b.A.spurt.354 No not the disfluencies	595.63	597.18	EN2002b.A.spurt.356

A: Okay there's	635.81	636.39	EN2002a.A.spurt.339 Yeah	646.17	646.54	EN2002a.D.spurt.341 They be good to have it at	646.53	647.83	EN2002a.C.spurt.342 Yeah	646.99	647.33	EN2002a.B.spurt.343
B: yeah	596.7	596.9	EN2002b.D.spurt.357 Okay	597.47	597.81	EN2002b.D.spurt.358 We could probably	598.5	599.14	EN2002b.D.spurt.359 Yeah	603.85	604.27	EN2002b.A.spurt.361
C: Target	591.0	591.6	EN2002d.C.spurt.352 I mean do we do we care if you know	591.46	593.57	EN2002d.B.spurt.353 Um	592.4	592.72	EN2002d.C.spurt.354 Yeah i dunno yeah it doesn't really matter what if we just Like the filter these out	593.21	597.3	EN2002d.D.spurt.355
A: I think it's fine it's fine yeah that would think so	647.15	649.68	EN2002a.D.spurt.344 But oh well can we i mean you probably i don't know if you wanna have like	648.3	652.86	EN2002a.B.spurt.345 So maybe you can just like	657.52	659.38	EN2002a.B.spurt.347 It's like uh the counter for something that you want so	663.61	666.7	EN2002a.A.spurt.349
B: Yeah i might be yeah	604.78	606.31	EN2002b.A.spurt.362 We could just make it up	605.04	605.79	EN2002b.D.spurt.363 i	606.31	606.89	EN2002b.A.spurt.364 So it and	606.75	607.42	EN2002b.C.spurt.365
C: But it will be difficult if you know If in the uh	597.81	601.06	EN2002d.B.spurt.357 They're pouring	612.14	612.73	EN2002d.D.spurt.360 For the speaker	621.28	621.91	EN2002d.B.spurt.362 Either that or do you do with lots and lots places you have a	630.61	633.21	EN2002d.C.spurt.364

C: So i don't do we want to	1161.01	1162.21	EN2002d.D.spurt.731 Said an actual hard deadline Or	1162.79	1165.5	EN2002d.D.spurt.732 Yeah in the shared yeah	1165.66	1166.99	EN2002d.B.spurt.733 Well that's the problem because steve hasn't given us any details of me	1169.3	1174.18	EN2002d.B.spurt.735
A: So yeah i was thinking we can probably	1212.22	1214.1	EN2002a.A.spurt.731 So i start attacking as seriously than just them	1214.51	1217.7	EN2002a.A.spurt.733 Yeah hopefully on something by next week that we can sort of try integrate into the green	1218.54	1222.66	EN2002a.A.spurt.734 Uh-huh	1223.06	1223.46	EN2002a.C.spurt.735
B: The um	1364.93	1365.54	EN2002b.C.spurt.764 Yeah you could be conditions were in as we know that would've can just in fact make a rabbit	1364.98	1369.34	EN2002b.B.spurt.765 Yeah	1367.23	1367.71	EN2002b.C.spurt.766 Yeah	1369.52	1369.92	EN2002b.C.spurt.767
C: Mm "'kay" well we yeah i guess we we can sell complete like test cases or whatever for	1173.56	1177.58	EN2002d.D.spurt.736 For the people want this to come up with scenarios	1178.05	1180.18	EN2002d.D.spurt.737 That's true	1180.44	1181.16	EN2002d.B.spurt.738 That sort of thing i mean that's	1180.75	1181.81	EN2002d.D.spurt.739

B: Would be the same thing	1370.41	1371.28	EN2002b.B.spurt.768 But then	1370.75	1371.35	EN2002b.C.spurt.769 You know the the the good way of doing it um	1372.51	1375.72	EN2002b.C.spurt.770 Not together is that be If someone doesn't wanna look at the the mm mm You know the chopped well then you don't have a half to produce it	1376.41	1384.08	EN2002b.C.spurt.771
C: That's	1182.23	1182.78	EN2002d.D.spurt.740 Fairly straight for And could actually fun	1183.44	1186.02	EN2002d.D.spurt.741 Yeah exactly	1187.02	1187.6	EN2002d.D.spurt.743 Make it up together	1188.03	1189.02	EN2002d.B.spurt.744
A: "'cause" it's now	1225.18	1225.94	EN2002a.B.spurt.740 The browsers i use it now or as uh	1226.49	1229.15	EN2002a.C.spurt.741 yeah	1229.15	1229.62	EN2002a.C.spurt.742 he was that one i took it	1229.62	1231.64	EN2002a.C.spurt.743
B: In a cat	1383.01	1383.5	EN2002b.B.spurt.772 Mm hmm so	1385.57	1386.35	EN2002b.C.spurt.773 But i mean you can you know you can ride we can	1387.15	1389.23	EN2002b.C.spurt.774 Right something like a um well trying to an on the fly in	1389.74	1392.86	EN2002b.C.spurt.775
C: That's true just brainstorm yeah	1188.05	1189.55	EN2002d.D.spurt.745 Yeah	1189.56	1189.92	EN2002d.B.spurt.746 No	1200.22	1200.59	EN2002d.A.spurt.748 Yeah that's true yeah	1200.64	1201.41	EN2002d.D.spurt.749
A: And uses the um	1232.61	1234.8	EN2002a.C.spurt.744 the n. x. t. sects to get the data out of that Ah the files	1234.8	1239.33	EN2002a.C.spurt.745 Okay	1236.98	1237.29	EN2002a.A.spurt.746 Which i think is a lot but i'm not quite sure how well i don't understand	1240.18	1243.67	EN2002a.C.spurt.747
B: And uh the if it's not gonna is gonna take to know if it's gonna take a while think about Writing it to	1393.37	1398.73	EN2002b.C.spurt.776 A file	1399.25	1399.85	EN2002b.C.spurt.777 Should know it's just the the just be used items when they were foster parents um	1400.07	1404.28	EN2002b.B.spurt.778 And in off line	1400.38	1401.33	EN2002b.C.spurt.779
C: So we can	1201.07	1201.74	EN2002d.A.spurt.750 So i think we could say monday	1201.3	1203.12	EN2002d.B.spurt.751 Yeah	1203.13	1203.51	EN2002d.D.spurt.752 Mm them all	1204.08	1205.61	EN2002d.A.spurt.753

B: I just said uh said well done so far along gonna be	1612.8	1615.22	EN2002b.B.spurt.879 Yeah well maybe you could	1615.19	1616.72	EN2002b.C.spurt.880 And some for some issues and then it's	1615.99	1618.06	EN2002b.B.spurt.881 Maybe you could split up and	1617.98	1619.32	EN2002b.C.spurt.882
C: That might be a very uh try and	1327.55	1329.06	EN2002d.C.spurt.847 And as you can like three or four maybe that would be good	1329.51	1332.47	EN2002d.D.spurt.848 But	1332.63	1332.82	EN2002d.B.spurt.849 Yeah i think that	1333.29	1334.07	EN2002d.D.spurt.850
A: Mm mm	1446.21	1446.99	EN2002a.C.spurt.852 Okay	1446.28	1446.56	EN2002a.D.spurt.853 okay	1446.56	1447.07	EN2002a.D.spurt.854 Yeah	1446.66	1446.95	EN2002a.B.spurt.855
B: Actually yeah that makes sense	1618.07	1619.27	EN2002b.D.spurt.883 Um	1620.53	1621.42	EN2002b.D.spurt.884 of like into each	1621.42	1622.47	EN2002b.D.spurt.885 I think you'll a stick	1622.73	1623.71	EN2002b.B.spurt.886
C: I think you know like ten	1333.68	1335.21	EN2002d.B.spurt.851 No	1335.1	1335.65	EN2002d.D.spurt.852 No uh	1335.27	1336.28	EN2002d.C.spurt.853 I mean i	1335.67	1336.71	EN2002d.B.spurt.854
A: Uh-huh	1448.61	1449.19	EN2002a.B.spurt.856 Yeah	1451.98	1452.25	EN2002a.B.spurt.857 Yeah	1454.15	1454.61	EN2002a.A.spurt.859 so so and we can	1454.61	1455.66	EN2002a.A.spurt.860
B: Yeah like yeah is what we've done already and then you know down here	1622.77	1626.28	EN2002b.C.spurt.887 Yeah	1623.57	1623.89	EN2002b.D.spurt.888 Yeah	1631.43	1631.77	EN2002b.D.spurt.890 Mm	1632.71	1633.39	EN2002b.C.spurt.891
C: That's a lot	1336.26	1336.76	EN2002d.D.spurt.855 okay i am i any guy analyse the results of uh	1336.28	1340.08	EN2002d.C.spurt.856 Yeah	1337.74	1338.06	EN2002d.D.spurt.857 Yeah exactly But the thing like	1338.7	1340.4	EN2002d.D.spurt.858
A: They also that in the middle one is true	1456.11	1457.82	EN2002a.D.spurt.861 I can't really can still thought it off i	1458.11	1460.83	EN2002a.C.spurt.862 Uh	1460.07	1460.39	EN2002a.A.spurt.863 huh huh	1460.39	1460.96	EN2002a.A.spurt.864
B: I think that does make sense but maybe at the end maybe just a a point form of you know things that	1633.73	1638.22	EN2002b.D.spurt.892 We're still working on things all day yeah	1638.84	1640.9	EN2002b.D.spurt.893 Maybe	1639.19	1639.55	EN2002b.C.spurt.894 Calls or something something like that but it will points	1639.82	1642.81	EN2002b.B.spurt.895
