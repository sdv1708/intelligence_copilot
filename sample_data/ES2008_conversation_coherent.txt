A: for so do individual work um into a meeting conceptual design individual work and a meeting 84.95 90.07 ES2008a.A.spurt.22
B: Which converts the data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver 1059.01 1065.2 ES2008b.B.spurt.361
C: And then the battery i think is worse things get most exciting were talking about long life batteries here we can we can have your sort of basic double a. batteries but we also have these options of um 271.05 282.12 ES2008c.B.spurt.78
D: And then you have all the sides take a little bit more three-dimensional you have your channel changing Volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle 304.52 312.22 ES2008d.B.spurt.129
A: Designing a remote control for television only 785.55 788.15 ES2008a.C.spurt.338
B: And the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared bulb Which will then bring the data to the receiver 1129.17 1137.31 ES2008b.B.spurt.394
C: Our next meeting starts in thirty minutes a new type things you look and feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay 2065.11 2074.08 ES2008c.A.spurt.788
D: Yeah my inspiration from from last time is The and interior of a remote control being taken up are bit by bit talk about circuit boards 1933.85 1941.16 ES2008d.B.spurt.996
A: I've used I do use remote controls things like T. v. and the c. d. player and Video recorder 551.08 558.12 ES2008a.C.spurt.223
B: alright so you have your energy source your user interface is controlling the chip That should also use the energy 1122.6 1128.63 ES2008b.B.spurt.392
C: The main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as well or the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip 194.96 201.55 ES2008c.B.spurt.63
D: I decided to what you know i sent you the email saying that powerpoint minutes will be complementary rather than like repeating i'm just gonna make i'm making four minutes so that will include all the agenda and all that 2423.3 2433.18 ES2008d.A.spurt.1222
A: After three separate remote controls The front of me you know one for the t. v. one for the digital box One for the video recorder as well 578.54 585.68 ES2008a.C.spurt.234
B: So all the components that we find your the energy source you know the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip 1051.64 1058.24 ES2008b.B.spurt.360
C: In technological elements we can add in the word latex titanium or rubber or other coloured Types of plastic 239.15 245.28 ES2008c.B.spurt.72
D: Could the middle button on the on screen menu function of the power button 264.54 268.0 ES2008d.D.spurt.106
A: You know doesn't have all the buttons that you need to programme the video recorder or 711.87 716.13 ES2008a.B.spurt.305
B: So we really need to focus in and those volumes And channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel settings because they're used much more infrequently in power which complicate 419.5 432.46 ES2008b.D.spurt.145
C: Using the kinetic battery like are used In high tech watches where you just have to move it a little bit to get it To power up 282.63 289.47 ES2008c.B.spurt.79
D: So i guess what we're gonna talk about here it is it just evaluating How we create this project information we got a menus how we use ten 1575.33 1582.36 ES2008d.A.spurt.816
A: Play in the court and stop buttons on a video recorder as well 841.94 845.14 ES2008a.C.spurt.370
B: That controls the converse the electrical energy into data Which then goes to the infrared so 1034.07 1039.57 ES2008b.B.spurt.357
C: Plastic them the main this'll be plastic but we have all these sort of fashion 234.31 238.72 ES2008c.B.spurt.71
D: I know would make it a little less could a little more confusing but if we had all the buttons in black and a designing and the outside and yellow that we're corpora wanna know we could also have alternative colours One a more conservative one one that's more fruity 946.48 959.1 ES2008d.A.spurt.465
A: Um are done is a is we're gonna do a little opening and then um i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project The whole thing to acquaint and such a strange know each other little bit 46.11 53.92 ES2008a.A.spurt.11
B: It's voice recognition which i kind of I kinda feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control 1775.78 1781.58 ES2008b.A.spurt.726
C: Then if you want to do anything more advanced you go into the little menu on the l. c. d. screen And see you use the buttons just a scroll around and and find the more advanced features you want 724.22 733.3 ES2008c.C.spurt.229
D: Uh the volume buttons rather if you press all at once they become channel changing buttons 160.75 165.47 ES2008d.B.spurt.61
A: And then the detailed design individual work and a meeting 90.63 93.63 ES2008a.A.spurt.23
B: The second is is economic uh we need to find a balance between Features and price uh as you mentioned things like Voice recognition but but at the price 705.05 714.15 ES2008b.C.spurt.233
C: The top one is double important to the second one which is double important the third one so 1146.47 1151.05 ES2008c.D.spurt.359
D: I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information like what's a single curved case how many colours What the colours cow 1623.34 1630.43 ES2008d.B.spurt.835
A: Technical functions i guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons 913.1 917.21 ES2008a.A.spurt.399
B: Mm it i think it does i don't i don't think about way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without 2048.3 2053.7 ES2008b.B.spurt.878
C: Or Ah have a just a menu display that comes up on the television and and be controlled through the device 833.76 839.92 ES2008c.C.spurt.263
D: It's see what did i get to the corporate website it just inspiration about circuit boards 1907.57 1912.52 ES2008d.B.spurt.984
A: the industrial design only now we we doing on the working design 903.71 907.86 ES2008a.A.spurt.394
B: Which are the remote control what we want to do it sends a message to the television saying Change channel change the volume 592.75 599.09 ES2008b.C.spurt.194
C: If we're gonna have pushbuttons the require a simple chip but a scroll wheel Requires a regular chip in an l. c. d. requires advanced 1721.41 1729.43 ES2008c.B.spurt.629
D: You've pressed slept three times in the menu with the other features And power possibly also with here 165.88 172.8 ES2008d.B.spurt.62
A: And i'm the user interface designer for the project 224.62 227.96 ES2008a.C.spurt.89
B: One on the right is a lot more basic it's just got it's essential functions of the t. v. changing the channel play stop volume 782.63 788.78 ES2008b.C.spurt.255
C: I think we also wanna go for it A simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down um we're only only need a regular or advanced chip if we're gonna start using An l. c. d. 386.87 396.75 ES2008c.B.spurt.107
D: The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing but i think it's one one of those things that m. i. t. t. five minutes to figure out 1071.19 1080.83 ES2008d.B.spurt.526
A: Like you say you don't like having all the buttons on one On one remote and yeah you don't wanna have five remotes 699.14 705.1 ES2008a.A.spurt.297
B: But it's really obvious to us i think um also You did some questions on voice recognition and uh and found that The desire for voice recognition was inverse be related to age so younger people were more inclined to 310.68 325.58 ES2008b.D.spurt.103
C: Right and they were gonna do the opening a minute or if you the minutes of the last meeting then we'll have your three presentations 79.71 85.25 ES2008c.A.spurt.28
D: that is in should not our market marketing um expert could not agree with the marketing um 2544.02 2548.99 ES2008d.A.spurt.1267
A: First of all our project aim um we're creating a new remote control which we have three goals about it needs to be original trendy and user-friendly 63.81 72.32 ES2008a.A.spurt.16
B: personally well What i want from a remote control is A device that simple it it's easy to use 817.32 823.42 ES2008b.C.spurt.270
C: Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery 290.14 293.34 ES2008c.B.spurt.80
D: Yeah that was one thing that we brought up over email i don't know if you picked up your email but um that the um feature that we considered 391.88 397.95 ES2008d.A.spurt.167
A: New product a new television remote control it's not like that 822.27 825.24 ES2008a.D.spurt.360
B: also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities A device to be is is is technological uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is 693.92 704.57 ES2008b.C.spurt.232
C: So you you have buttons for your favourite channel changing the volume which is something you do all the time when you're watching t. v. 789.23 794.6 ES2008c.C.spurt.249
D: Well you just Every time you wanna go back in the menu button again it brings you back one 632.59 636.49 ES2008d.B.spurt.309
A: Compact three parts first the functional design which will be 80.69 83.99 ES2008a.A.spurt.20
B: And engineering based Design for a remote control so it's one has got lots of buttons it's it's fully featured 758.23 765.17 ES2008b.C.spurt.251
C: Real reaction uses the most often but we also have a scroll scroll wheels which can have integrated push buttons or we could go all high-tech in have an l. l. c. d. screen 252.84 262.3 ES2008c.B.spurt.76
D: Now when you're um creating your um prototypes you did you work together or did you like to separate projects 2049.11 2055.17 ES2008d.A.spurt.1045
A: Just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um 493.51 496.57 ES2008a.A.spurt.200
B: Energy going to the user who's controlling the chip will 1085.34 1088.08 ES2008b.B.spurt.368
C: The main features of the ipod the things you would use all all the time 719.51 722.58 ES2008c.C.spurt.227
D: But that has a menu button separate from uh select a button or is this this one's the but the menu and the select button 637.2 642.33 ES2008d.A.spurt.311
A: They tend to be a bit confusing that Too many buttons on them 589.67 592.55 ES2008a.C.spurt.240
B: And what people do most often in is changing the channel and changing the volume People are so is that makes change the channel 406.0 414.21 ES2008b.D.spurt.141
C: I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seen a menu and seeing what's on um 929.77 935.36 ES2008c.A.spurt.298
D: Oh rate um and the the design it match that appropriate dave remember really we discussed that People don't use a lot of buttons that they use the channel four be in the volume the most 986.95 998.48 ES2008d.D.spurt.491
A: It's a bit simpler to show us buttons that would even need to be on it 856.2 859.81 ES2008a.B.spurt.376
B: Um the user interface is critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip 1027.78 1033.66 ES2008b.B.spurt.356
C: There's a like a hard plastic Inside it just cover with the latex 1854.42 1858.52 ES2008c.B.spurt.683
D: Uh this middle button it brings up down screen menu 237.45 240.16 ES2008d.C.spurt.96
A: A record of functions on that 797.91 799.13 ES2008a.C.spurt.345
B: It's not remotes were ugly seventy five percent of the a hundred subjects 294.0 298.3 ES2008b.D.spurt.98
C: Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one a regular one or an advanced one depending on what are other needs are 263.76 270.4 ES2008c.B.spurt.77
D: They're in together powerpoint of no no information and last time it was like the opposite And so much information and so much to talk about 2182.04 2188.88 ES2008d.B.spurt.1107
A: Remotes ten to have buttons that the t. v.s no longer have as well 770.78 774.09 ES2008a.A.spurt.329
B: so that this is this the the think about working design as they what we're trying to do is working designers figure out how Yep rate it apparatus can fulfil its function 934.58 945.02 ES2008b.B.spurt.328
C: complications with solar battery says and we can use a latex cases If we have a solar battery 297.32 302.57 ES2008c.B.spurt.83
D: I mean how fashionable can you make a remote i think it's pretty in technology in fashion to get the real really well 1198.33 1203.77 ES2008d.D.spurt.579
A: Um i'm just gonna have a powerpoint presentation for us for the kick-off meeting 37.47 41.35 ES2008a.A.spurt.9
B: Appeals What's the whiteboard range of ages i mean we we said Simplicity is is one of the features so it's going to 1855.14 1862.82 ES2008b.C.spurt.771
C: You can't have the television send information back to the remote control 975.95 978.96 ES2008c.C.spurt.315
D: Let's move on to the project evaluation 1563.19 1565.01 ES2008d.A.spurt.812
A: Our next meeting starts in thirty minutes 887.72 890.56 ES2008a.A.spurt.389
B: one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grind or It works because it converts electrical energy to granting the beans 946.13 954.17 ES2008b.B.spurt.331
C: So do we do they have a small l. c. d. display on the device itself 828.35 833.25 ES2008c.C.spurt.262
D: The cost than the budget to the project evaluated 1774.36 1777.67 ES2008d.A.spurt.906
A: Are we gonna be discussing and the next meeting 972.7 974.54 ES2008a.C.spurt.420
B: Team make a schematic of the way that the Energy is converted 993.57 997.35 ES2008b.B.spurt.345
C: The concept of the user interface list of device 585.39 588.66 ES2008c.C.spurt.182
D: Up and down buttons which are also gonna be a channel selector "'s" and we have our little menu button here 151.2 155.99 ES2008d.B.spurt.58
A: That's lovely meeting um 1021.61 1022.84 ES2008a.A.spurt.446
B: And they are designed to sort of like this you have your energy source rate there which Then 1067.77 1074.56 ES2008b.B.spurt.363
C: And otherwise no matter how many buttons we have are in have like you know black with red sitting on that though it's gonna Not really sort of start looking like 1773.45 1781.34 ES2008c.D.spurt.650
D: Yeah but in menus or submenus and so how'd you get back to the main menu 626.28 630.72 ES2008d.A.spurt.305
A: If it's if the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes 754.2 758.07 ES2008a.B.spurt.323
B: A sliding screen on the remote control that Hides all the complicated buttons 1654.36 1659.26 ES2008b.C.spurt.661
C: Is a a fairly simple device this is an an ipod from apple um 682.1 686.91 ES2008c.C.spurt.213
D: Channel up channel down and that 230.87 232.69 ES2008d.C.spurt.94
A: Okay so maybe have like one remote that has the main function of the on off channel changing volume 761.24 766.05 ES2008a.A.spurt.327
B: We need a chip that works well with the user interface that isn't too complicated 1155.86 1160.4 ES2008b.B.spurt.402
C: Protecting the circuit board i think that that's time for us 1869.27 1871.79 ES2008c.B.spurt.689
D: that would be one of your channels Basically said like channels or that would be 257.55 261.97 ES2008d.C.spurt.102
A: Just a television that we want to control 835.81 837.8 ES2008a.C.spurt.367
B: Energy or information to the chip which 1079.46 1082.29 ES2008b.B.spurt.366
C: I dunno so Down kind of button but the volume control could double for that 2054.37 2058.39 ES2008c.C.spurt.782
D: There might be something that you can do in the circuit board in the chip 465.12 468.2 ES2008d.B.spurt.206
A: Having too many remotes around my dad has a whole drawer At home of remotes for various things i don't know how to work half of them 606.91 614.47 ES2008a.B.spurt.253
B: So i had a look on the on the web to uh to see if i could find a few examples of existing Television remote controls 720.02 727.63 ES2008b.C.spurt.237
C: for channel surfing i think a scroll uh an actual i got ipods kind of scroll thing would be too fast 1951.17 1956.23 ES2008c.A.spurt.728
D: And with that and with the powerpoint that we can all look at like you can do all those things pretty much some powerpoint 2020.18 2024.9 ES2008d.A.spurt.1031
A: Oh and i guess i'm the industrial designer 155.79 157.83 ES2008a.B.spurt.55
B: as a lot of features that are missing from that remote control So we've got uh 800.41 804.17 ES2008b.C.spurt.262
C: What does it take to make a remote control and What should we make our specific remote control out of 178.02 183.71 ES2008c.B.spurt.60
D: a tech-mind i was like would you prefer an l. c. d. screen or multi-function remote control that didn't have like any kind of table 1963.02 1969.27 ES2008d.D.spurt.1007
A: User interface designer that's real that so 910.32 912.55 ES2008a.A.spurt.398
B: it's got big buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the volume changing the channel 824.26 828.54 ES2008b.C.spurt.272
C: I'm bizarre minutes from the functional design we sat our target group it is that uh "'cause" on who can afford it would because we have international be on we said it's for all age groups different um 93.6 103.42 ES2008c.A.spurt.32
D: Use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system And the middle button how to select 243.11 248.61 ES2008d.C.spurt.98
A: could have like to you by your experiences using rubber remote controls 496.57 500.03 ES2008a.A.spurt.201
B: Um how do we have to go about designing a new television remote control 605.08 609.04 ES2008b.C.spurt.197
C: the extra functions and the more advanced features 662.59 665.6 ES2008c.C.spurt.207
D: Well how they actually market it to some remote control the company them 1841.37 1845.19 ES2008d.B.spurt.945
A: Um your first ideas about um creating a new remote control would be the best 500.48 505.34 ES2008a.A.spurt.203
B: Is it in given it much important and visibility On the remote as a minute channel changing that to use a lot more often 461.38 467.97 ES2008b.D.spurt.157
C: A few buttons to select your favourite channels i mean most people when they watch t. v. 778.99 783.24 ES2008c.C.spurt.246
D: which is in a latex cases Wayne fruity colours that's curved 88.36 92.61 ES2008d.A.spurt.32
A: If we're gonna make a remote control it should actually work for what it's doing 652.55 655.79 ES2008a.B.spurt.273
B: Is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes with the television Is that would affect the way that we marketing 1481.42 1489.42 ES2008b.C.spurt.582
C: Um you know how to make a decision on the remote control concepts 85.89 88.99 ES2008c.A.spurt.29
D: Could lose them in your pocket that you just go for that that Or like put it down somewhere like made sense and then 2290.97 2296.67 ES2008d.D.spurt.1158
A: My name is rose and then i'll be the project manager 41.95 44.21 ES2008a.A.spurt.10
B: Say like it at a hundred a new remote control in this this kind of Index appears 1313.51 1318.24 ES2008b.C.spurt.493
C: We go in fruit and vegetable colours we could colour currently time 1340.31 1343.63 ES2008c.B.spurt.437
D: are we sure this is double curved maybe it's single curved 1488.26 1490.66 ES2008d.A.spurt.765
A: Uh nor moving to the project plan to little discussion in close as we only have twenty five minutes uh-huh 56.46 62.13 ES2008a.A.spurt.14
B: That's i'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control 569.91 575.2 ES2008b.C.spurt.188
C: What i'm gonna pressing buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press that 1418.12 1422.33 ES2008c.B.spurt.485
D: Yeah and out and buy and more market research of them and threatened that shortly we could've taken that into account 1640.68 1646.8 ES2008d.D.spurt.841
A: On this project 158.54 159.44 ES2008a.B.spurt.56
B: Um i guess real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred subjects and the usability lab 263.47 269.22 ES2008b.D.spurt.90
C: A bit like a bit like how they have these sound digital box is where you you press buttons and it comes up with your 905.96 912.21 ES2008c.C.spurt.292
D: I found that we did that we could've used another five or ten minutes 2152.83 2156.23 ES2008d.A.spurt.1089
A: okay i'm rose and and project manager uh-huh 375.68 378.56 ES2008a.A.spurt.143
B: Want something with voice recognition whereas the older people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell 326.05 332.51 ES2008b.D.spurt.105
C: Is that the button on an ipod is it What is it is it just for buttons or is it a lot more like a scroll thing 1436.11 1442.14 ES2008c.C.spurt.497
D: You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push somebody or 134.11 137.64 ES2008d.B.spurt.52
A: It at a project finance is um with a couple uh-huh 450.4 454.23 ES2008a.A.spurt.184
B: Yeah or at at at maybe some buttons could be yellow but we can we can play around a little bit 1419.35 1424.04 ES2008b.A.spurt.553
C: they had people they blinked on the important aspects of a remote control 1106.21 1110.42 ES2008c.D.spurt.352
D: Created something really interesting and then we have a market for it um 1784.46 1788.35 ES2008d.A.spurt.912
A: fifty million euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it uh it would market range of the internet like it's in international market range we do have to worry about specifics 460.31 471.12 ES2008a.A.spurt.189
B: Okay we have to worry about four minutes left to to find a functions so let's do that quickly 1945.81 1950.59 ES2008b.A.spurt.826
C: "'kay" were um concepts concepts of user interface 522.94 526.41 ES2008c.A.spurt.165
D: Alright and same sort of scale for functionality is a functional 777.3 781.68 ES2008d.D.spurt.377
A: The television you should have to walk all around the room together to turn on so it's just simpler 643.78 648.49 ES2008a.B.spurt.269
B: Just with reference it as a set of the fact that like it's about We need a long lasting energy source people don't wanna be changing it a lot 1148.89 1155.35 ES2008b.B.spurt.400
C: We have five minutes after the meeting some hmm 1761.99 1764.89 ES2008c.A.spurt.644
D: Yeah but basically This inspiration and basically mean if you to send to i. and fashion than 1923.26 1929.83 ES2008d.D.spurt.993
A: This device is just to be used for the television 791.41 793.99 ES2008a.C.spurt.342
B: This is our functional design meeting 58.22 59.91 ES2008b.A.spurt.7
C: When you get on the on screen menu of all your functions that your remote 1793.93 1797.5 ES2008c.B.spurt.657
D: That was the last one like a chosen not to do a powerpoint saying that they made sense chairs are like they have the option to do that and just take my own notes and whole sort of thing 1667.08 1675.47 ES2008d.D.spurt.854
A: To stick to having Television 804.03 806.05 ES2008a.C.spurt.348
B: User interface the user interface concept market trend were watching 2125.12 2129.57 ES2008b.A.spurt.912
C: It it lets you just sit there and and control the television from your armchair 871.82 876.19 ES2008c.C.spurt.277
D: Slide what kind of button they'll we want to how many buttons And then to choose what colours want to make the buttons uh 347.69 354.29 ES2008d.C.spurt.149
A: Television like that 806.77 807.65 ES2008a.C.spurt.349
B: Everything you might possibly want to do is there you know it's got for the backwards up down channel numbers volume uh freeze frame 765.74 772.97 ES2008b.C.spurt.252
C: And i'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery 365.48 368.11 ES2008c.B.spurt.101
D: It was inspired by the tail So i think it's really fruity 969.41 972.98 ES2008d.B.spurt.476
A: If it's just a television on that 854.41 855.78 ES2008a.B.spurt.375
B: sixty five percent uh-huh 415.61 417.5 ES2008b.D.spurt.143
C: A kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight 477.39 479.73 ES2008c.B.spurt.141
D: the war have the prototype presentation in a look at the evaluation criteria 62.83 66.97 ES2008d.A.spurt.22
A: we're gonna get snow it a little bit uh-huh 101.61 103.24 ES2008a.A.spurt.30
B: Now those are That's all specific for speech recognition are we gonna use that as whatever functions uh-huh 1535.18 1540.83 ES2008b.A.spurt.606
C: I dunno what do people think about this kinetic battery idea 1613.85 1617.08 ES2008c.B.spurt.586
D: i'll talk about the minutes from last meeting what we just discussed 58.1 61.28 ES2008d.A.spurt.20
A: I was a little bit off 242.01 242.88 ES2008a.C.spurt.95
B: And basically in order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like that it has a fancy appeal And that it's not a play and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it so it doesn't give them an mean 468.52 481.43 ES2008b.D.spurt.158
C: I think it may be better to it Put our money into the Stuff like the kinetic battery in the cold case 1970.2 1976.3 ES2008c.B.spurt.734
D: Right well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email 399.96 403.67 ES2008d.B.spurt.169
A: I give it a little bit of snout had no teeth 418.06 421.63 ES2008a.A.spurt.169
B: I think or fifty percent of the people mention that that was the biggest frustration and You or are so frustrated with the difficulty it is 351.64 359.41 ES2008b.D.spurt.114
C: Pushbuttons at least unless we get any information i have no idea how much more expensive the scroll wheel is then 1959.81 1965.95 ES2008c.B.spurt.732
D: back to agenda 1553.51 1554.34 ES2008d.A.spurt.806
A: A fine then they can be a bit annoying especially 572.92 575.97 ES2008a.C.spurt.231
B: voice recognition the younger people dead 1446.14 1448.97 ES2008b.A.spurt.564
C: Design the features of on the concepts making sure that we get 655.23 658.29 ES2008c.C.spurt.204
D: I think overall "'cause" we it said before are two main things are simplicity in fashion and so those are the mexicans are not uh 1167.17 1172.94 ES2008d.D.spurt.563
A: Okay seems a little bit of a complex over um 687.93 690.59 ES2008a.A.spurt.291
B: uh talk about the new project requirements that just received 97.85 100.3 ES2008b.A.spurt.22
C: So you hold it in one hand And you press You press the buttons are fun and 1422.22 1427.08 ES2008c.C.spurt.487
D: It's interesting what came out like later like as i was doing them a nice dinner break down the on the agenda for they gave me on that more points came out from your presentation even 2189.7 2199.36 ES2008d.A.spurt.1108
A: There's not too many buttons are not too small you know 623.28 626.24 ES2008a.B.spurt.258
B: Information is projected to the receiver and 1018.69 1021.09 ES2008b.B.spurt.353
C: there's there's a shape Of the case we could do a flat which uh flat case the curved case or it maybe even a double double curved case 217.5 225.11 ES2008c.B.spurt.68
D: In order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like 2214.58 2219.83 ES2008d.B.spurt.1118
A: But that just has your major buttons 721.08 723.65 ES2008a.B.spurt.308
B: Technical so in there we have technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements 2190.76 2197.31 ES2008b.B.spurt.944
C: All the essential functions in the device and so 658.83 661.52 ES2008c.C.spurt.205
D: And when you're working on screen menu 240.82 242.68 ES2008d.C.spurt.97
A: Whatever else you know programmed into it it's all just ended the place and not like all the on button see a doctor know like i don't even know what i'm trained on 745.01 751.7 ES2008a.D.spurt.317
B: That's the data in do it from like an earlier project i think so 2181.78 2184.66 ES2008b.A.spurt.938
C: Probably with a variety of design elements maybe take a new maybe some word we're gonna have to investigate that better when i guess specifics of the actual materials 335.32 343.94 ES2008c.B.spurt.94
D: You can still have that in between them or you can see a year kind of back and find it but anywhere also it's gonna stand out 1136.26 1142.71 ES2008d.D.spurt.551
A: It's an idea of the buttons being the or um 861.55 864.09 ES2008a.D.spurt.377
B: The the chip that uh i think he in this designing it's gonna be Crucial 1040.05 1044.6 ES2008b.B.spurt.358
C: I may be want something that's shaped like a mobile phone so you you hold it in one and then you press the buttons are fun 1396.31 1402.12 ES2008c.C.spurt.469
D: Circuits and chips and 1951.28 1952.65 ES2008d.B.spurt.1002
A: Teeny mobile phones size buttons If we can help it 872.36 875.58 ES2008a.B.spurt.384
B: Was that in this meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes so 105.97 109.82 ES2008b.A.spurt.24
C: The titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space program 444.92 449.27 ES2008c.B.spurt.125
D: Project process 1566.15 1567.41 ES2008d.A.spurt.813
A: A introduce yourself um say one thing about yourself and then try your favourite animal what else about it 117.19 122.86 ES2008a.A.spurt.39
B: using a remote control is is quite subjective experience 651.17 655.04 ES2008b.C.spurt.218
C: Probably push buttons but i'm sure it intrigued by the idea of a scroll 347.93 351.55 ES2008c.B.spurt.96
D: How much of your powerpoint was already done for you Every meeting 2447.0 2450.09 ES2008d.B.spurt.1230
A: Right so and so's to draw my favourite animal i have no drawing skills whatsoever 132.92 137.71 ES2008a.B.spurt.45
B: as i said before remote controls all subjective Different people want one different things 810.88 815.95 ES2008b.C.spurt.267
C: I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons It's very minimalist taken this design 687.8 693.84 ES2008c.C.spurt.215
D: It was interesting know that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration what was in the remote and that they didn't provide is that information to 2246.47 2253.11 ES2008d.A.spurt.1136
A: Not necessarily "'cause" it's i have a solution favourite animal but is that 171.7 175.48 ES2008a.B.spurt.63
B: working sanders figure out What you need to make it sell this practical function 974.36 978.82 ES2008b.B.spurt.338
C: A kind of back light in it "'cause" it to be tend to watch t. v. in the dark 890.04 893.46 ES2008c.C.spurt.285
D: Well the thing as you would provide a an agenda was like several points but it wouldn't have a side for each point 2465.65 2470.48 ES2008d.A.spurt.1238
A: Quite tech rid of oh animals they can split they can 205.55 208.3 ES2008a.B.spurt.78
B: And then we have to make a decision on a remote control functions i will disclose 100.89 105.5 ES2008b.A.spurt.23
C: Well that i see my gonna be making quite a small device 883.48 886.42 ES2008c.C.spurt.282
D: I find the choice that he wants and you press 649.3 651.48 ES2008d.C.spurt.318
A: Try and for my favourite animal 232.05 233.25 ES2008a.C.spurt.91
B: So maybe it's more useful to just to just find an object it's like fashions and possibly tend to find specific 1893.02 1898.48 ES2008b.A.spurt.795
C: Is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod 824.75 827.78 ES2008c.C.spurt.261
D: You know user creativity with the information 1585.12 1587.09 ES2008d.A.spurt.818
A: It's fun and interesting animal 300.04 301.19 ES2008a.C.spurt.115
B: I. d. industrial design if you're components concept 2121.09 2124.59 ES2008b.A.spurt.911
C: To access the main features are you can just about make up 707.57 710.48 ES2008c.C.spurt.221
D: Hand if indeed it's made of latex the rubber i read it so and yellow i 907.23 911.86 ES2008d.D.spurt.445
A: That animals 323.72 324.49 ES2008a.D.spurt.122
B: uh first meeting later Let's make that but something for us to consider also just the number on that bus it's more When it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use Make sure that you know something like 445.76 459.14 ES2008b.D.spurt.155
C: no but i guess maybe if we decided on like a simple a regular or advanced chip maybe 1700.95 1706.36 ES2008c.A.spurt.623
D: And the volume down on the other side yeah 223.29 225.31 ES2008d.C.spurt.91
A: I was thinking in a really beautiful animal has an eye mm 437.79 441.52 ES2008a.A.spurt.178
B: an emphasis on making the infrared very functional so you don't have to travel around a lot 1725.93 1730.53 ES2008b.A.spurt.702
C: The second thing that was an agenda as important was that technological innovation that would be like if we use something like this base material uh uh 1154.41 1162.16 ES2008c.D.spurt.361
D: A little bit more of a creative feel 292.17 293.83 ES2008d.B.spurt.124
A: So like you have to have some some work as you can um we need a special functions occasionally 774.51 778.35 ES2008a.A.spurt.331
B: Like make the infrared more functional like why would it not be 1737.2 1740.28 ES2008b.D.spurt.707
C: I see like a round remote instead of like a rubber button down one like in terms of holding that Like that so if she or a fruit uh-huh 1368.75 1376.63 ES2008c.D.spurt.454
D: Yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i'm gonna say it's like a story 740.64 744.43 ES2008d.D.spurt.358
A: Very excited to see our animals 947.35 949.24 ES2008a.A.spurt.412
B: I dunno we'll have our lunch break and after that we have thirty minutes of individual work 2104.59 2108.65 ES2008b.A.spurt.907
C: Stuff inside but it's covered with the latex it's a spongy and softer on your hands 1298.4 1302.46 ES2008c.B.spurt.417
D: You know we like we'll have yellow and black 1374.63 1376.47 ES2008d.B.spurt.693
A: All different Remotes together on a on a plate 528.16 530.97 ES2008a.D.spurt.216
B: Maybe i mean by get more numbers but you know you before the next meeting in terms of ages 1803.37 1808.45 ES2008b.D.spurt.743
C: An onscreen display on the television 899.87 901.82 ES2008c.C.spurt.290
D: I think it give it a four tera that's a pretty high learning curve it'll be easy once you've done it but 1107.79 1111.92 ES2008d.A.spurt.540
A: about like batteries and things like that like either some remotes that all the dark where 658.01 662.36 ES2008a.D.spurt.275
B: To learn how to use a remote And i think that ties that's what you're saying before Just that there's too many buttons it just needs to be easy to use 359.98 368.21 ES2008b.D.spurt.118
C: I have two hundred fifty channels on the t. v. and they watch 784.0 786.76 ES2008c.C.spurt.247
D: I think we really got into it i mean i got into it and so they went on i got really like from when designing a remote control 2237.62 2243.55 ES2008d.B.spurt.1132
A: Did combining all the remotes can together versus having 692.06 695.34 ES2008a.A.spurt.293
B: The parts of the working design it need to be figured out 1143.8 1146.93 ES2008b.B.spurt.398
C: in a specific functions or something to keep the remote from getting lost 109.77 113.87 ES2008c.A.spurt.36
D: Special form they're all kind of just push button 1443.85 1446.78 ES2008d.A.spurt.734
A: By different remotes 696.15 697.19 ES2008a.A.spurt.295
B: Basically communication device we 590.18 592.26 ES2008b.C.spurt.193
C: Like how these questions a bit more data and if necessarily this whole fashion and technology you eat it easy to use is necessarily 1225.86 1233.92 ES2008c.D.spurt.386
D: Things you can put on the keys that you press it and it'll beep 2261.68 2264.31 ES2008d.A.spurt.1144
A: Maybe that's spatial a divided so it's like if your body if you're trying to get the t. v. on that's not the top banana remote i don't have a beep or a corporate an hour 730.72 738.64 ES2008a.D.spurt.315
B: And as as per last time you get specific in cat instructions from your personal coach emailed to you 2130.2 2136.27 ES2008b.A.spurt.913
C: was keeping a very small and simple set of buttons 844.91 848.08 ES2008c.C.spurt.267
D: I can wake it that's hard to press 581.44 583.4 ES2008d.B.spurt.271
A: I'm not the right remote with all the special things because that is one thing that um 766.45 770.43 ES2008a.A.spurt.328
B: did you look at the minutes i emailed them to you and also putting on them in the shared folder so 87.47 91.94 ES2008b.A.spurt.19
C: Um do we sat on a chip let's go with the simple chip okay 2078.15 2081.73 ES2008c.A.spurt.794
D: I think it's It's functional is also Pretty basic I'll give it a two 788.06 792.27 ES2008d.C.spurt.381
A: I'm still a lot of them that normal remote 781.16 783.33 ES2008a.A.spurt.335
B: How is it Mean you can bulk really great and some of the same a phnom button them i dunno i'm gonna buy a new remote 1579.68 1585.91 ES2008b.D.spurt.629
C: Yeah any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery 1637.55 1641.37 ES2008c.B.spurt.599
D: It it might be that's our corporate colours in it 937.53 939.77 ES2008d.B.spurt.460
A: For that work for everything you know volume control 724.07 726.99 ES2008a.B.spurt.309
B: i'll make sure but on the minutes in the project documentation and including this powerpoint slides if i want to do that as well to be great 2109.77 2116.27 ES2008b.A.spurt.909
C: It's double curved like would that be like two hands kind of time 416.83 420.35 ES2008c.D.spurt.114
D: That's right yeah corporate colour we didn't keep that in 940.27 942.69 ES2008d.A.spurt.461
A: Uh-huh 2.07 2.64 ES2008a.D.spurt.1
B: But this doesn't divide up anything and i was only a hundred subjects also Which isn't I mean 1809.06 1815.01 ES2008b.D.spurt.746
C: Yeah if you're watching t. v. in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons which 761.62 765.28 ES2008c.C.spurt.241
D: Let's make sure we keep that in mind that we had that one of our colour just concept is corporate and has the r. r. on a uh-huh 1261.4 1266.56 ES2008d.A.spurt.611
A: Uh-huh 5.53 6.22 ES2008a.D.spurt.2
B: We gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design 674.55 678.19 ES2008b.C.spurt.226
C: But it's it's It's something to bear in mind is that If we put the display on the remote control 966.76 971.7 ES2008c.C.spurt.312
D: The two three buttons here uh for adjusting the volume 218.98 221.71 ES2008d.C.spurt.89
A: Uh-huh 7.68 8.01 ES2008a.D.spurt.3
B: a fairly standard this requirements when the users using a remote control He or she expects the buttons to be in certain places So in some sense we're gonna 665.19 673.98 ES2008b.C.spurt.225
C: The l. c. d. screen things like that and then you could use was the third most important so 1162.77 1167.13 ES2008c.D.spurt.362
D: Does it go to put a lot of features that would make it really 845.62 848.45 ES2008d.D.spurt.411
A: I 11.25 11.47 ES2008a.D.spurt.4
B: The remote their own remote controls like that yeah 1649.1 1652.12 ES2008b.C.spurt.657
C: Kind of thing you could scroll through like you can use your buttons to scroll through of thing 1944.08 1947.69 ES2008c.A.spurt.725
D: And if it's made of like latex that whole idea that's pretty cool well there are three 840.53 844.7 ES2008d.D.spurt.408
A: Uh-huh 20.18 20.64 ES2008a.D.spurt.5
B: Using ten percent of the buttons 400.14 402.6 ES2008b.D.spurt.139
C: I know if we do have a double curved case it can have any titanium in it 439.48 443.42 ES2008c.B.spurt.124
D: I don't know i don't think it's quite as fashionable spiro one remote 1204.13 1206.82 ES2008d.B.spurt.580
A: Mm 31.83 32.12 ES2008a.D.spurt.6
B: in your analysis of different market um that the marketing 1433.95 1436.56 ES2008b.A.spurt.560
C: let's go to u. of user interface and we'll come back to the chip i suppose 1892.11 1895.52 ES2008c.A.spurt.700

D: like texting the thumb might find it a bit 1046.71 1048.68 ES2008d.B.spurt.512
A: i'm glad you can come and really set aside esteem 34.27 36.85 ES2008a.A.spurt.8
B: What what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that down 979.65 984.16 ES2008b.B.spurt.339
C: I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions i wasn't really given any options i was just given that this is how other done 1668.4 1674.37 ES2008c.B.spurt.607

C: I hit my understanding of old latex cases that it's in fact hard to protect 1292.95 1297.6 ES2008c.B.spurt.416
D: Once a four Hi changing Channels 227.01 230.4 ES2008d.C.spurt.93
A: Including a tool training exercise 54.37 56.05 ES2008a.A.spurt.13
B: Source and talk a little bit about 257.43 258.69 ES2008b.D.spurt.88

D: Um it's between Your favourite channels that you select a 233.09 236.66 ES2008d.C.spurt.95
A: Uh-huh 57.23 58.08 ES2008a.D.spurt.15
B: They might be overwhelmed with with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology 1600.36 1605.13 ES2008b.B.spurt.639
C: Like favourite channels is is applicable but i think you do you do need to have some kind of function work 937.78 942.66 ES2008c.A.spurt.300
D: Tell it what your favourite channels are and that 1095.46 1097.49 ES2008d.C.spurt.532
A: I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those 72.85 75.78 ES2008a.A.spurt.17
B: Which uh it's meant to explain it like it was just a simple either that's where this way they have like the meantime the menu like paul something a kind of "'em" like you got the rest buttons but there are some um like when and 1638.93 1648.55 ES2008b.D.spurt.654
C: It's simply it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons and it is a scroll button 1929.98 1933.49 ES2008c.C.spurt.718
D: Yeah i think the last time we had a lot of information 2159.77 2162.0 ES2008d.A.spurt.1094
A: Um 77.12 77.66 ES2008a.A.spurt.18
B: I think there's a certain a market for technology to looks cool 865.53 868.73 ES2008b.C.spurt.290
C: And you press the centre button that's that's your all purpose select a button right there 1467.63 1471.8 ES2008c.B.spurt.505
D: Yeah something still little bright to make it hard to lose but 384.83 388.17 ES2008d.B.spurt.164
A: So we're gonna define this up in the three uh 78.05 80.16 ES2008a.A.spurt.19
B: Yeah it's it's fully featured and 773.55 775.91 ES2008b.C.spurt.253
C: And that would allow you to access access the advanced features 840.38 843.78 ES2008c.C.spurt.265
D: It be harder to break hard to lose 919.36 921.11 ES2008d.B.spurt.452
A: Um 84.55 84.95 ES2008a.A.spurt.21
B: But not as prominent as the main features 1992.3 1994.03 ES2008b.C.spurt.847
C: Ah it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around the buttons are 753.37 758.11 ES2008c.C.spurt.239
D: Keeping uh meetings the time Secondly actually 2102.03 2104.66 ES2008d.C.spurt.1068
A: Uh-huh 92.01 92.6 ES2008a.D.spurt.24
B: On the television screen just and some text things and they 1318.75 1322.44 ES2008b.C.spurt.496
C: What kind of model is a going to be for user interaction with this device 646.15 649.77 ES2008c.C.spurt.201
D: Uh we have the on off button at the chip Very visible very big 144.89 149.05 ES2008d.B.spurt.55
A: So the what you need to be doing our own ideas might come together and 94.31 97.35 ES2008a.A.spurt.25
B: the chip transmitting information 1694.24 1695.82 ES2008b.A.spurt.684
C: So few buttons remain things but then i go back to the menu know 1486.73 1489.78 ES2008c.D.spurt.513
D: Um we use in push buttons 95.1 96.63 ES2008d.A.spurt.34
A: Um 97.69 98.17 ES2008a.A.spurt.26
B: The battery and that i think that the chip 1745.5 1748.02 ES2008b.B.spurt.712
C: "'kay" the push button 1719.33 1720.79 ES2008c.B.spurt.628
D: If you're just pushing is normally they're the many buttons if you 158.05 160.38 ES2008d.B.spurt.60
A: Collaborating 98.91 99.64 ES2008a.A.spurt.27
B: And then you have to press function f. eight so i think it is and yellow 186.73 190.45 ES2008b.C.spurt.51
C: And right now it They're saying that Currently there is a functional look and feel 1111.09 1116.66 ES2008c.D.spurt.353
D: It is just push buttons um 871.8 873.69 ES2008d.C.spurt.426
A: Uh-huh 100.79 101.37 ES2008a.D.spurt.28
B: Okay a whole eight years you're using a remote then why would you will always like you're in a minute like you would need or are you the structure t. a. 1789.62 1796.19 ES2008b.D.spurt.734
C: and start start something that that or show you some examples of 633.52 636.79 ES2008c.C.spurt.197
D: And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons or you're constantly push and uh 1031.29 1035.89 ES2008d.A.spurt.506
A: Okay 101.14 101.61 ES2008a.A.spurt.29
B: Did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition uh-huh 333.01 336.92 ES2008b.D.spurt.107
C: The lot disadvantages than an l. c. d. display would have to be quite small "'cause" we're 877.26 881.43 ES2008c.C.spurt.279
D: Not true at all False is the remote that we've created Conforms to the following criteria so we can do this one first 721.55 729.53 ES2008d.D.spurt.354
A: So um 103.72 104.92 ES2008a.A.spurt.31
B: We could use it and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into that 1561.87 1565.24 ES2008b.C.spurt.620
C: You control for your remote control ah 902.28 904.78 ES2008c.C.spurt.291
D: Emails and 1987.95 1988.63 ES2008d.B.spurt.1016
A: we're gonna do is start off with um 104.92 107.07 ES2008a.A.spurt.32
B: But then we've also got fashion which is something that definitely appeals to younger people 1871.53 1875.62 ES2008b.C.spurt.778
C: Depends when you when you use a remote Press the buttons where you're from you 1386.28 1390.37 ES2008c.C.spurt.463
D: Normally we go with for fruity colours but maybe We're also thinking that you should have 365.28 369.96 ES2008d.B.spurt.156
A: Let's start off with the me now um 107.95 110.6 ES2008a.A.spurt.33
B: Yeah straight-forward interface like he was saying simple not 1161.73 1165.14 ES2008b.B.spurt.405
C: Uh market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted 1090.93 1095.55 ES2008c.D.spurt.347
D: Something for losing the remote 2209.28 2210.69 ES2008d.A.spurt.1114
A: Okay 109.94 110.25 ES2008a.B.spurt.34
B: The only breaks um i was given in terms of each was the voice activation and basically there's a big john 1500.08 1505.17 ES2008b.D.spurt.588
C: Complicated features A want something that looks nice and simple 676.99 680.31 ES2008c.C.spurt.212
D: I am sure yes we're losing like he is rights i guess that's our last the remote 2309.35 2313.7 ES2008d.B.spurt.1166
A: only my sorry only one 110.6 112.1 ES2008a.A.spurt.35
B: And that people who don't wanna have or a look at and never even have to see that um and if you like to get the instruction manual it comes at the end you just only when really going on or even know what else things can pull out And you're happy person than ever uh not doesn't have to have like two remotes one that has the easy one the one that has 1670.12 1685.27 ES2008b.D.spurt.669
C: But this idea of the kinetic that you don't have to replace and uh a simple to shaking around will make it work 376.91 382.19 ES2008c.B.spurt.104
D: It's the minutes to make the rubber A way to maybe 1467.7 1470.54 ES2008d.D.spurt.750
A: Um 112.67 113.14 ES2008a.A.spurt.36
B: Do you have for main components 1065.84 1067.3 ES2008b.B.spurt.362
C: um so we're doing it on screen menu then we can scroll through 2019.01 2022.34 ES2008c.A.spurt.757
D: In five minutes 2148.71 2149.28 ES2008d.B.spurt.1088
A: we're gonna do a little tool training so we're gonna work that whiteboard behind yeah 113.14 116.81 ES2008a.A.spurt.37
B: The quality The quality of all the components really i mean 1757.51 1760.49 ES2008b.B.spurt.719
C: So i i like uh like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often 771.59 777.13 ES2008c.C.spurt.244
D: And at cape may minutes 2421.51 2422.67 ES2008d.A.spurt.1221
A: I 117.13 117.58 ES2008a.B.spurt.38
B: And really it all comes down to the to the user because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design 1045.06 1050.46 ES2008b.B.spurt.359
C: So conceptual design meeting 65.72 67.22 ES2008c.A.spurt.23
D: The market it or is it is a well it can 2549.95 2551.9 ES2008d.A.spurt.1270
A: Okay 123.61 124.3 ES2008a.B.spurt.40
B: Like how much money they have to stand or something like that like why did you have to use a button on the television and 1882.27 1888.01 ES2008b.D.spurt.783
C: So push or scroll Right 1914.17 1918.13 ES2008c.A.spurt.711
D: I've really big market i. b. c. one just have 2555.87 2558.4 ES2008d.D.spurt.1274
A: Um 124.81 125.5 ES2008a.B.spurt.41
B: Although why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement everything were talking about is Ease of use and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean 1586.03 1594.29 ES2008b.B.spurt.632
C: So we need to examine each element separately but we're designing awful thing see wanna keep it integrated as a whole 188.06 194.48 ES2008c.B.spurt.62
D: So is it a bit of both really are we just kind of start out by each taking a colour of clay and 2071.11 2075.64 ES2008d.B.spurt.1057
A: I don't know which one of these i have to bring with me 126.43 128.79 ES2008a.B.spurt.42
B: And then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work 958.91 966.31 ES2008b.B.spurt.334
C: Maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruit 1364.99 1367.01 ES2008c.B.spurt.451
D: Could have up to three i mean the buttons could each could be up to three colours as as far as design there 1435.05 1440.21 ES2008d.A.spurt.729
A: Probably both 129.43 130.12 ES2008a.A.spurt.43
B: But uh the energy 2055.06 2055.74 ES2008b.C.spurt.880
C: Personally like i might reverse it but In four working for this company that i guess the matter what we have to stress fashion the most but 1235.83 1242.25 ES2008c.D.spurt.388
D: But still the look-and-feel design presentation first 108.56 111.44 ES2008d.A.spurt.39
A: Mm 131.11 131.14 ES2008a.B.spurt.44
B: Takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering 1748.75 1752.24 ES2008b.B.spurt.713
C: i'm a little hesitant about it because i'm worried about protecting stuff on the inside 1835.36 1838.61 ES2008c.A.spurt.671
D: What are the finances and finally it to production evaluation and close 67.49 72.32 ES2008d.A.spurt.24
A: But uh alessi introduce myself my name is uh we not pretending a um 138.48 143.05 ES2008a.B.spurt.46
B: That's all the functional design objectives 111.87 113.95 ES2008b.A.spurt.25
C: Large buttons for the essential functions 114.36 116.75 ES2008c.A.spurt.37
D: That's all they're evaluation 475.86 477.33 ES2008d.A.spurt.211
A: Uh-huh 138.68 139.41 ES2008a.A.spurt.47
B: That extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have 120.9 124.09 ES2008b.A.spurt.27
C: Um and the conceptual specification of the user interface and then the trendwatching uh-huh 135.3 140.64 ES2008c.A.spurt.43
D: why don't we do a product evaluation using the criteria if you don't send me 543.77 547.2 ES2008d.A.spurt.243
A: Mm 141.45 142.02 ES2008a.A.spurt.48
B: And the working design how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function 124.67 128.71 ES2008b.A.spurt.28
C: You can do it does have its problems as well if you've got a small t. v. and it's sitting on the other side we're going So out of it a little text comes up 917.51 924.09 ES2008c.C.spurt.295
D: Not so much "'cause" we need on the l. c. d. screen we don't have a teacher up Other than what it looks like i don't know if it's 822.13 829.48 ES2008d.D.spurt.398
A: I'm from 143.54 144.27 ES2008a.B.spurt.49
B: That thing to do is to come up with the design specifications 610.04 613.06 ES2008b.C.spurt.198
C: My thumb remote corner fair on the touch scroll wheel 1427.91 1430.42 ES2008c.B.spurt.491
D: Well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to have a corporate logo so let's 1256.14 1260.96 ES2008d.A.spurt.610
A: The state of maine in the u. s. and doing a show them studies 144.71 148.4 ES2008a.B.spurt.50
B: To find out Find a way of striking a balance between the two 804.61 807.71 ES2008b.C.spurt.264
C: Simple regular advanced chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor so we do not sure about that 1710.78 1716.41 ES2008c.B.spurt.626
D: I know i'm really get them the homing no idea screen you know i mean 1649.46 1653.44 ES2008d.D.spurt.847
A: Well upon have an artistic talents 149.25 151.23 ES2008a.B.spurt.51
B: That's probably a a population of quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway so 1526.24 1532.1 ES2008b.B.spurt.602
C: And probably in colours maybe free vegetable colours 1882.36 1884.85 ES2008c.A.spurt.695
D: Okay so i don't get me links to the corporate website 1903.16 1905.49 ES2008d.A.spurt.980
A: I sat in a uh-huh 152.07 153.4 ES2008a.A.spurt.52
B: It's really hard to figure out right now 1850.77 1852.88 ES2008b.B.spurt.768
C: The two essential properties of the user interface we wanted to be simple 594.52 598.56 ES2008c.C.spurt.185
D: Seriously use your remote control would 460.06 462.2 ES2008d.C.spurt.204
A: A l. i n. a. 153.07 154.58 ES2008a.B.spurt.53
B: i'll i'll figure that out in the meantime uh-huh 2226.1 2228.06 ES2008b.A.spurt.961
C: However we've also got a member of that this is the device itself is useful but it's a 603.35 608.53 ES2008c.C.spurt.188
D: I wonder why actually The political part a remote control know if i really do too 1941.84 1946.04 ES2008d.B.spurt.998
A: Uh-huh 155.62 156.26 ES2008a.D.spurt.54
B: Need to stop i considering what remote control actually is it's uh 578.11 582.11 ES2008b.C.spurt.190
C: The device r. And make sure that 616.33 618.49 ES2008c.C.spurt.191
D: Friends partners and i wrote it all down because i thought it would be relevant by all the different parts of inside a remote control but then 1953.22 1960.2 ES2008d.B.spurt.1003
A: So let's see if i can get 160.38 161.97 ES2008a.B.spurt.57
B: Remote controls are uh uh 663.64 665.19 ES2008b.C.spurt.224
C: That we've included all of our is and that we actually end up The device that 620.55 624.32 ES2008c.C.spurt.193
D: Well and who are detailed design meeting 38.54 41.04 ES2008d.A.spurt.12
A: Mm 161.08 161.45 ES2008a.D.spurt.58
B: What can we do to make a product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls 742.99 747.73 ES2008b.C.spurt.243
C: How how is this device going to work how How 641.6 645.38 ES2008c.C.spurt.200
D: So the case material we just have one colour right but then the buttons will be in special colours 1418.63 1423.42 ES2008d.A.spurt.718
A: Um 162.38 163.58 ES2008a.B.spurt.59
B: numbers new remote control 1308.23 1309.78 ES2008b.C.spurt.488
C: Yeah i would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing 1843.23 1848.45 ES2008c.A.spurt.678
D: Double curved 1331.22 1332.44 ES2008d.B.spurt.657
A: here 163.58 164.03 ES2008a.B.spurt.60
B: I suspect a remote control does think about it 2041.93 2044.13 ES2008b.C.spurt.874
C: And the limelight battery or charging station uh-huh 122.03 124.93 ES2008c.A.spurt.39
D: Single curve 1509.86 1510.84 ES2008d.A.spurt.776
A: I'll draw a little 165.2 166.31 ES2008a.B.spurt.61
B: I mean i guess i'll go for fifty percent of of the for the crash a segment can have that was the biggest one and 1922.08 1928.26 ES2008b.D.spurt.809
C: And the battery hmmm these are all things that we had sort of addressed before but 202.02 205.44 ES2008c.B.spurt.65
D: I think it's it's kind of main do we do 972.49 974.16 ES2008d.A.spurt.478
A: Turtle for you all huh 167.9 169.83 ES2008a.B.spurt.62
B: Device that allows us to 582.76 585.53 ES2008b.C.spurt.191
C: Or solar battery although there are slight 293.79 296.08 ES2008c.B.spurt.81
D: Okay it's kinetic battery that's kind of expensive but we have a sample chip 1505.82 1509.26 ES2008d.A.spurt.774
A: Um 171.83 172.33 ES2008a.D.spurt.64
B: Yeah i would imagine Just "'cause" it is an electronic device uh 2044.57 2048.15 ES2008b.A.spurt.875
