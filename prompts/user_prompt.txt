TASK: Analyze the meeting context and create a comprehensive, executive-ready MeetingBrief JSON.

THINK ABOUT:

1. LAST_MEETING_RECAP:
   - What were the key outcomes and decisions from previous meetings?
   - What has changed or evolved since then?
   - What unresolved threads need attention?
   - Why do these matter for the upcoming meeting?
   - Provide a detailed summary (3-5 sentences minimum) that gives full context

2. OPEN_ACTION_ITEMS:
   - What actions are pending and who owns them?
   - Which items are critical vs. nice-to-have?
   - Are there dependencies or blockers to flag?
   - What's the strategic importance of each item?
   - For each item, explain WHY it matters, not just WHAT it is
   - Include specific context about urgency, impact, or dependencies

3. KEY_TOPICS_TODAY:
   - What are the most critical topics that need discussion?
   - For each topic, explain:
     * What decision needs to be made or what outcome is needed?
     * Why is this topic important right now?
     * What's at stake if we don't address it?
     * What background context or preparation might be needed?
   - Format each topic as: "Topic Name: [Detailed explanation of why it matters, what needs to be decided, what's at stake, and any strategic implications]"
   - Be specific and detailed - don't just list topic names
   - Identify underlying issues, opportunities, or strategic implications

4. PROPOSED_AGENDA:
   - How should time be allocated to maximize value?
   - What's the logical flow of topics?
   - What outcomes should each agenda item achieve?
   - Where might the discussion get stuck or need facilitation?
   - Start with quick wins, then tackle complex topics
   - Include time for decisions, not just updates
   - For each topic, suggest: What outcome should we achieve?

5. EVIDENCE:
   - What key facts, data, or quotes support your analysis?
   - What patterns or trends emerge from the materials?
   - What concerns or red flags should the executive know about?
   - Include actionable quotes or data points
   - Highlight any concerning trends or red flags

USE YOUR JUDGMENT:
- Think beyond what's written to what's implied or missing
- Identify strategic opportunities and risks
- Connect ideas across different materials
- Add context that helps the executive prepare mentally
- Reason about priorities, trade-offs, and next steps
- Be insightful about the "why" and "so what"
- Provide detailed, comprehensive content - executives need full context

SCHEMA:
{
  "meeting_title": string,
  "time_window": string or null (format: "YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD" if inferable),
  "last_meeting_recap": string (detailed summary with key outcomes and changes - 3-5 sentences minimum),
  "open_action_items": [
    {
      "owner": string (name or "TBD"),
      "item": string (specific action with context on why it matters - be detailed),
      "due": string or null (YYYY-MM-DD format),
      "status": "open" | "blocked" | "done"
    }
  ],
  "key_topics_today": [
    string (format: "Topic Name: [Detailed explanation of why it matters, what needs to be decided, what's at stake, and any strategic implications]")
  ],
  "proposed_agenda": [
    {
      "topic": string (what + desired outcome),
      "minutes": int (estimated duration),
      "owner": string or null (who leads this topic)
    }
  ],
  "evidence": [
    {
      "source": string (format: "material_id#c{chunk_idx}"),
      "snippet": string (relevant excerpt with context)
    }
  ]
}

Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, no extra text.

CRITICAL JSON RULES:
- Double quotes for all strings
- No trailing commas (e.g., NOT: ["item1", "item2",])
- Escape quotes inside strings with \"
- Close all brackets properly
- Be detailed and comprehensive in all string fields
