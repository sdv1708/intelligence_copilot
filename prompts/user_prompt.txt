TASK: Analyze the meeting context and create an executive-ready MeetingBrief JSON.

If context is missing critical details, draw on relevant business knowledge, similar engagements, and reasonable assumptions to deliver a complete, high-value brief. Explicitly tag any assumption-based insights with "Assumption:" so the executive knows where judgment was applied.

THINK ABOUT:

1. LAST_MEETING_RECAP:
   - What were the key outcomes and decisions?
   - What has changed or evolved since then?
   - What unresolved threads need attention?
   - Why do these matters for the upcoming meeting?

2. OPEN_ACTION_ITEMS:
   - What actions are pending and who owns them?
   - Which items are critical vs. nice-to-have?
   - Are there dependencies or blockers to flag?
   - What's the strategic importance of each item?

3. KEY_TOPICS_TODAY:
   - What are the most important things to discuss?
   - What decisions need to be made and why?
   - What's at stake if we don't address these topics?
   - Are there underlying issues or opportunities to surface?

4. PROPOSED_AGENDA:
   - How should time be allocated to maximize value?
   - What's the logical flow of topics?
   - What outcomes should each agenda item achieve?
   - Where might the discussion get stuck or need facilitation?

5. EVIDENCE:
   - What key facts, data, or quotes support your analysis?
   - What patterns or trends emerge from the materials?
   - What concerns or red flags should the executive know about?

USE YOUR JUDGMENT:
- Think beyond what's written to what's implied or missing
- Identify strategic opportunities and risks
- Connect ideas across different materials
- Add context that helps the executive prepare mentally
- Reason about priorities, trade-offs, and next steps
- Be insightful about the "why" and "so what"
- Integrate external market, customer, or operational signals when they improve the narrative (note when they are inferred)

SCHEMA:
{
  "meeting_title": string,
  "time_window": string or null (format: "YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD" if inferable),
  "last_meeting_recap": string (detailed summary with key outcomes and changes),
  "open_action_items": [
    {
      "owner": string (name or "TBD"),
      "item": string (specific action with context on why it matters),
      "due": string or null (YYYY-MM-DD format),
      "status": "open" | "blocked" | "done"
    }
  ],
  "key_topics_today": [string (topic + why it's important)],
  "proposed_agenda": [
    {
      "topic": string (what + desired outcome),
      "minutes": int (estimated duration),
      "owner": string or null (who leads this topic)
    }
  ],
  "evidence": [
    {
      "source": string (format: "material_id#c{chunk_idx}"),
      "snippet": string (relevant excerpt with context)
    }
  ]
}

Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, no extra text.

CRITICAL JSON RULES:
- Double quotes for all strings
- No trailing commas (e.g., NOT: ["item1", "item2",])
- Escape quotes inside strings with \"
- Close all brackets properly
