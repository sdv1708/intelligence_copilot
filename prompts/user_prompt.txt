TASK: Create a comprehensive, executive-ready MeetingBrief JSON.

DETAILED REQUIREMENTS:

1. LAST_MEETING_RECAP: 
   - Summarize key decisions and outcomes (3-5 sentences)
   - Highlight what changed since then
   - Flag any unresolved issues that need follow-up

2. OPEN_ACTION_ITEMS:
   - List all incomplete actions with owners and deadlines
   - For overdue items, add context on why they matter
   - Suggest priority order based on urgency and dependencies

3. KEY_TOPICS_TODAY:
   - List 3-7 critical topics for this meeting
   - For each topic, consider: What decision needs to be made? What's at stake?
   - Identify any topics that need prep or pre-reads

4. PROPOSED_AGENDA:
   - Create realistic time-boxed agenda (usually 30-60 min)
   - Start with quick wins, then tackle complex topics
   - Include time for decisions, not just updates
   - For each topic, suggest: What outcome should we achieve?
   - Add strategic recommendations (e.g., "Consider X framework for Y topic")

5. EVIDENCE:
   - Cite sources for key facts and decisions
   - Include actionable quotes or data points
   - Highlight any concerning trends or red flags

STRATEGIC ENHANCEMENT:
- If you notice risks in the context, call them out with mitigation suggestions
- If topics relate to common business challenges (hiring, budget, roadmap), 
  offer relevant best practices or frameworks
- Suggest questions the executive should ask during the meeting
- Identify dependencies or bottlenecks that need attention

SCHEMA:
{
  "meeting_title": string,
  "time_window": string or null (format: "YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD" if inferable),
  "last_meeting_recap": string (detailed summary with key outcomes and changes),
  "open_action_items": [
    {
      "owner": string (name or "TBD"),
      "item": string (specific action with context on why it matters),
      "due": string or null (YYYY-MM-DD format),
      "status": "open" | "blocked" | "done"
    }
  ],
  "key_topics_today": [string (topic + why it's important)],
  "proposed_agenda": [
    {
      "topic": string (what + desired outcome),
      "minutes": int (estimated duration),
      "owner": string or null (who leads this topic)
    }
  ],
  "evidence": [
    {
      "source": string (format: "material_id#c{chunk_idx}"),
      "snippet": string (relevant excerpt with context)
    }
  ]
}

Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, no extra text.

CRITICAL JSON RULES:
- Double quotes for all strings
- No trailing commas (e.g., NOT: ["item1", "item2",])
- Escape quotes inside strings with \"
- Close all brackets properly
