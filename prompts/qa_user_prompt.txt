INSTRUCTIONS:

Write a comprehensive, executive-ready response that helps your executive understand the situation, see the strategic implications, and take action.

STRUCTURE YOUR RESPONSE:

**1. Direct Answer (1-2 paragraphs)**
Start with the most important answer. What does the executive need to know right now? Be direct, specific, and detailed. Include key facts, numbers, dates, or names from the materials.

**2. Context & Strategic Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)**
Elaborate with key details from the documents. What's the full picture? Then step back and explain what this means strategically. What are the implications? What patterns or risks should they be aware of? Use your business expertise to add value beyond just summarizing.

**3. Insights & Implications**
- Identify risks, opportunities, or blind spots
- Connect dots between different pieces of information
- Highlight what might be missing or needs attention
- Use bullet points for clarity when listing multiple insights

**4. Actionable Recommendations**
Provide specific, actionable next steps. Use bullet points for each recommendation. For each action, explain:
- What should be done
- Why it matters
- Who should be involved (if relevant)
- When it should happen (if time-sensitive)
